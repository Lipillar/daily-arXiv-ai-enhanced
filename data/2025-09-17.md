### [1] [MTEB-NL and E5-NL: Embedding Benchmark and Models for Dutch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12340)
*Nikolay Banar,Ehsan Lotfi,Jens Van Nooten,Cristina Arhiliuc,Marija Kliocaite,Walter Daelemans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对荷兰语在嵌入资源中的代表性不足问题，发布了MTEB-NL基准测试、训练数据集和E5-NL嵌入模型系列，以促进荷兰语嵌入技术的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰语在多语言嵌入资源中代表性不足，通常只占已发布资源的一小部分，需要专门针对荷兰语的嵌入评估和生成资源来弥补这一差距。

Method: 1) 创建MTEB-NL基准测试，包含现有荷兰语数据集和新创建的数据集；2) 提供基于可用荷兰语检索数据集编译的训练数据集，并通过大语言模型生成合成数据扩展任务覆盖范围；3) 发布紧凑高效的E5-NL嵌入模型系列。

Result: 开发了全面的荷兰语嵌入评估基准、训练数据集和高效的嵌入模型，所有资源都通过Hugging Face Hub和MTEB包公开提供。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了荷兰语嵌入资源的空白，为荷兰语嵌入技术的进一步发展提供了重要基础，有助于推动荷兰语在自然语言处理中的应用。

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

### [2] [MORABLES: A Benchmark for Assessing Abstract Moral Reasoning in LLMs with Fables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12371)
*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES是一个基于寓言和短篇故事的人类验证基准，用于评估LLM的道德推理能力，发现即使大型模型也容易受到对抗性攻击，存在显著的自相矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在标准阅读理解基准上的优异表现，需要评估它们在复杂抽象推理和推断方面的能力，文学类基准因其丰富的叙事和道德深度为此提供了合适框架。

Method: 构建MORABLES基准，包含从历史文学中提取的寓言和短篇故事，设计多项选择题针对道德推理，并创建对抗性变体来测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 大型模型表现优于小型模型，但对对抗性操作敏感，依赖表面模式而非真正的道德推理，最佳模型在约20%情况下会自我矛盾，推理增强模型未能弥补这一差距。

Conclusion: 规模而非推理能力是性能的主要驱动因素，LLM在道德推理方面存在脆弱性，容易受到提示框架的影响而产生自相矛盾。

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Judge: Rapid Evaluation of Legal Document Recommendation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12382)
*Anu Pradhan,Alexandra Ortan,Apurv Verma,Madhavan Seshadri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究在法学推荐系统中使用LLM作为评估者的可行性，发现传统评估指标存在误导性，提出了更稳健的评估指标和统计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的兴起，传统评估指标无法捕捉法学等专业领域的细微质量维度，需要探索LLM作为评估者的可靠性。

Method: 通过系统性实验，比较不同评估者间可靠性指标，使用Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数作为评估者选择指标，采用Wilcoxon符号秩检验进行系统比较。

Result: 发现传统指标如Krippendorff's alpha在AI系统评估的偏态分布中具有误导性，Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数更稳健，Wilcoxon检验提供统计严谨性。

Conclusion: 提出了一条实现可扩展、成本效益高的评估路径，将人力密集型瓶颈转化为自动化且统计严谨的评估框架。

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

### [4] [SENTRA: Selected-Next-Token Transformer for LLM Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12385)
*Mitchell Plyler,Yilun Zhang,Alexander Tuzhilin,Saoud Khalifah,Sen Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SENTRA检测器，基于Transformer编码器，利用选定下一个词概率序列和对比预训练，在跨域文本检测中显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强和普及，其被滥用的风险增加，需要检测未明确声明的LLM生成文本

Method: 使用Transformer-based编码器，基于selected-next-token-probability序列，在大规模无标注数据上进行对比预训练

Result: 在3个公共数据集24个文本领域的实验中，SENTRA在跨域设置下显著优于流行基线方法

Conclusion: SENTRA是一个通用的分类器，能有效检测LLM生成的未声明文本

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

### [5] [MORQA: Benchmarking Evaluation Metrics for Medical Open-Ended Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12405)
*Wen-wai Yim,Asma Ben Abacha,Zixuan Yu,Robert Doerning,Fei Xia,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORQA是一个新的多语言医疗问答评估基准，包含专家编写的多个参考答案和专业人工评分，研究发现基于大语言模型的评估方法在医疗领域显著优于传统自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的自然语言生成评估面临独特挑战，传统自动评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE等）在区分高质量输出方面存在不足，特别是在开放式医疗问答任务中可能存在多个有效回答。

Method: 构建MORQA多语言基准，包含英语和中文的医疗视觉和文本问答数据集，每个问题提供2-4个以上医学专家编写的参考答案和专家人工评分，对比评估传统指标和基于LLM（如GPT-4、Gemini）的评估方法。

Result: 基于大语言模型的评估方法在相关性方面显著优于传统指标，LLM对语义细微差别敏感且对参考答案的变异性具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这是医疗领域首个全面的多语言NLG评估定性研究，强调了需要与人类判断对齐的评估方法，所有数据集和标注将公开发布以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

### [6] [MedFact: Benchmarking the Fact-Checking Capabilities of Large Language Models on Chinese Medical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12440)
*Jiayi He,Yangmin Huang,Qianyun Du,Xiangying Zhou,Zhiyang He,Jiaxue Hu,Xiaodong Tao,Lixian Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MedFact中文医疗事实核查基准，包含2116个专家标注实例，涵盖13个医学专科和8种错误类型，评估显示LLMs在错误定位方面仍远逊于人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗领域LLM评估基准数据范围狭窄，无法反映真实世界医疗信息的复杂性，需要构建更全面的评估体系来确保LLM在医疗应用中的事实可靠性。

Method: 采用混合AI-人类框架构建基准，通过迭代专家反馈优化AI驱动的多标准筛选过程，涵盖13个医学专科、8种错误类型、4种写作风格和多个难度级别。

Result: 评估20个主流LLM发现，模型虽能判断文本是否含错，但精确定位错误仍是重大挑战，顶级模型性能仍不及人类专家，且存在过度批评现象。

Conclusion: MedFact揭示了LLM在医疗应用中面临的关键挑战，为开发更可靠、医学感知更强的模型提供了重要资源，推动医疗AI的事实可靠性发展。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

### [7] [Topic Coverage-based Demonstration Retrieval for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12451)
*Wonbin Kweon,SeongKu Kang,Runchu Tian,Pengcheng Jiang,Jiawei Han,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopicK是一个基于主题覆盖的检索框架，通过识别测试输入所需的细粒度知识主题并评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平，迭代选择能够覆盖模型知识不足主题的演示示例，从而提升上下文学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法通常仅基于嵌入相似度或生成概率来检索演示示例，这往往导致选择到不相关或冗余的例子，无法全面覆盖测试输入所需的细粒度知识需求。

Method: 提出TopicK框架：1）估计测试输入所需的主题；2）评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平；3）迭代选择能够引入先前未覆盖且模型知识水平低的主题的演示示例。

Result: 在多个数据集和开源/闭源大语言模型上进行了广泛实验，验证了TopicK的有效性。

Conclusion: TopicK通过基于主题覆盖的检索方法，能够更全面地满足测试输入的知识需求，显著提升了上下文学习的性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

### [8] [Does Language Model Understand Language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12459)
*Suvojit Acharjee,Utathya Aich,Asfak Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了SOTA语言模型在英语和孟加拉语中对时态、否定、语态等精细语言现象的理解能力，发现Compound-Beta模型在跨语言场景中与人类判断最为一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在教育技术中的广泛应用，需要确保其与人类语言理解的一致性，特别是在联合国SDG 4强调语言清晰度的教育背景下。

Method: 引入RECISE评估指南和LUCID数据集，使用标准统计指标和创新的HCE准确度指标评估多个SOTA模型在英语和孟加拉语中的表现。

Result: Compound-Beta模型表现最均衡，在英语中获得了最高的Pearson相关性，在混合语言数据上表现稳健，显示出与人类判断的强一致性。

Conclusion: 语言模型在精细语言理解方面仍需改进，Compound-Beta模型在跨语言场景中表现出色，为教育技术应用提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

*Sumanta Bhattacharyya,Sara Riaz,Pedram Rooshenas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2tA方法通过精炼大语言模型的推理轨迹来训练任务特定的小型推理模型，解决了高质量标签稀缺的问题，在数据库设计评估任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当直接人工监督或高质量标签稀缺时，训练任务特定的小型推理模型具有挑战性。大语言模型产生的丰富中间推理轨迹可以被系统精炼，为训练提供有效的监督信号

Method: 提出Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA)方法：1) 使用开源基础模型生成初始推理和响应；2) 精炼这些推理轨迹，修复幻觉和不一致性；3) 进行两阶段对齐：监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，使模型中间推理与人类验证的概念偏好对齐

Result: 在扩展实体关系图(EERD)评估任务中，使用包含600个变体的数据集（450训练/150测试），涵盖11个错误类别。R2tA方法在结构复杂任务中表现优于仅提示方法，减少了错误遗漏和幻觉

Conclusion: R2tA为数据稀缺领域的大语言模型适应提供了实用、经济高效的路径，能够为教育等领域开发可复现的AI工具

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

TL;DR: FunAudio-ASR是一个基于大语言模型的大规模语音识别系统，通过结合海量数据、大模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习，在实际应用场景中实现了最先进的性能表现，特别针对实际部署进行了优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型驱动的语音识别取得了显著进展，但LLM容易产生幻觉问题，在实际ASR应用中会显著降低用户体验。现有LLM-based ASR系统在开源基准上表现良好，但在实际工业评估集上往往表现不佳。

Method: 结合海量数据、大模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习，特别针对流式处理能力、噪声鲁棒性、代码切换、热词定制等实际应用需求进行优化。

Result: FunAudio-ASR在实际应用数据集上实现了SOTA性能，证明了其在实践环境中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了生产导向的优化对于LLM-based ASR系统在实际部署中的重要性，FunAudio-ASR系统在复杂语音识别场景中表现出卓越的性能和实用性。

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

TL;DR: 本文比较了三种训练巴姆巴拉语机器翻译模型的pipeline，发现简单的transformer模型在低资源语言翻译中表现最佳，达到10% BLEU和21% chrF分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为非洲曼德语系的巴姆巴拉语（约1418万使用者）开发有效的机器翻译系统，解决低资源语言翻译的挑战

Method: 三种方法：1）简单transformer法语-巴姆巴拉语翻译；2）LLaMA3微调；3）语言蒸馏结合LaBSE嵌入和BERT扩展

Result: 第一个pipeline表现最好：Bayelemagaba数据集上10% BLEU和21% chrF，Yiri数据集上33.81% BLEU和41% chrF。基于instructor的模型在单一数据集上表现更好

Conclusion: 简单transformer架构在低资源语言翻译中优于复杂模型，instructor模型更适合特定数据集模式，为低资源语言翻译提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

TL;DR: 提出零样本自动音频字幕生成系统，利用预训练音频CLIP模型提取特征并生成结构化提示，指导大语言模型生成字幕，相比传统方法在NLG平均分数上提升35%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动音频字幕生成面临数据集有限的问题，需要克服训练数据不足的挑战

Method: 使用预训练音频CLIP模型提取听觉特征，生成结构化提示来指导大语言模型进行字幕生成，采用MAGIC搜索优化词元选择

Result: 实验结果显示NLG平均分数从4.7提升到7.3，性能提升35%，性能受音频-文本匹配模型和关键词选择影响显著

Conclusion: 零样本方法有效解决了数据稀缺问题，单关键词提示可获得最佳性能，无关键词列表时性能下降50%

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EconProver方法，通过动态CoT切换机制和多样化并行强化学习，显著降低大语言模型在自动定理证明中的计算成本，仅用12%的计算成本就能达到基准方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在自动定理证明中采用测试时扩展策略（如反射式CoT推理和增加采样次数）虽然性能提升显著，但带来了巨大的计算开销，且现有成本分析忽略了不同扩展策略带来的采样成本差异。

Method: 提出了两种互补方法：1）动态CoT切换机制，减少不必要的token消耗；2）多样化并行强化学习与可训练前缀，在有限采样次数下提高通过率。这两种方法可集成到统一的EconRL流程中。

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet数据集上的实验表明，EconProver仅需12%的计算成本就能达到基准方法的可比性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为部署轻量级自动定理证明模型提供了可行的见解，在不牺牲性能的前提下显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE位置编码存在内在的距离依赖偏差，限制了长上下文建模能力，且现有扩展方法需要预训练后调整

Method: 提出Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)，在注意力机制中引入可学习相位函数

Result: TAPA能保持长距离token交互，通过轻量微调扩展到更长上下文，外推到未见长度，在长上下文困惑度上显著优于RoPE

Conclusion: TAPA是一种有效的位置编码方法，解决了RoPE的长上下文限制问题，具有更好的扩展性和性能

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

TL;DR: 提出发音感知上下文框架(PAC)，通过两阶段学习解决LLM语音识别中的发音建模和同音词区分问题，显著降低词错误率和长尾词识别偏差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大语言模型的语音识别系统中发音建模效果不佳和同音词区分能力弱的问题，这对于原始词和长尾词的准确识别至关重要

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式：1)发音引导的上下文学习方法，使用交错字素-音素上下文建模策略；2)发音判别强化学习方法，通过扰动标签采样增强同音词区分能力

Result: 在英文Librispeech和中文AISHELL-1数据集上，相比预训练LLM-ASR模型，相对词错误率分别降低30.2%和53.8%；长尾词偏差词错误率相对降低31.8%和60.5%

Conclusion: PAC框架有效提升了语音识别系统的发音建模能力和同音词区分性能，在英文和中文数据集上都取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种检测大型语言模型意识形态偏见的方法，通过分析模型输出在相关主题提示下的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态操控，适用于黑盒系统的审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在数百万用户产品中的广泛应用，其输出可能影响个人信念和塑造公众舆论。如果LLMs可以被有意引导到特定意识形态立场，控制这些系统的组织可能对公共话语产生不成比例的影响。

Method: 采用先前提出的统计方法，适应意识形态偏见审计的新背景。该方法具有模型无关的设计，不需要访问语言模型内部结构，而是通过分析模型在选定主题相关提示下的输出分布变化来识别潜在意识形态操控。

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了该方法的有效性，证明了其实际适用性和支持独立事后审计LLM行为的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测LLM意识形态操控提供了有效的工具，特别适合对专有黑盒系统进行审计，有助于确保语言模型的公正性和透明度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过强化学习缓解大语言模型在情感支持对话中策略规划偏好偏差的方法，通过双奖励函数优化策略规划的准确性和置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在情感支持对话中存在策略规划准确性低和明显偏好偏差的问题，现有方法虽然通过微调策略规划器减少偏差，但偏差的根本原因尚未深入研究。

Method: 首先揭示大语言模型在策略规划中的知识边界，然后提出基于强化学习的双奖励函数方法，根据知识边界通过准确性和基于熵的置信度来优化策略规划。

Result: 在ESCov和ExTES数据集上的多个大语言模型骨干网络实验表明，该方法优于基线方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功缓解了大语言模型在情感支持对话中的策略规划偏好偏差，通过识别知识边界和双奖励函数优化，显著提升了策略规划的性能。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于机制解释性技术的新策略，通过识别毒性分类器中的脆弱组件来改善对抗攻击下的性能，并在不同人口群体中发现了公平性和鲁棒性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM生成内容的快速增长，传统基于人类文本训练的毒性分类器在面对LLM生成文本和对抗攻击时出现误分类问题，现有防御策略多为被动反应型。

Method: 使用微调的BERT和RoBERTa分类器，通过对抗攻击技术识别脆弱电路，然后抑制这些脆弱电路来提升性能。研究覆盖多个少数群体的多样化数据集。

Result: 发现模型存在对性能关键或易受攻击的特定注意力头，抑制脆弱头能改善对抗输入的性能。不同人口群体的脆弱性由不同头负责，这为开发更具包容性的毒性检测模型提供了见解。

Conclusion: 通过机制解释性方法识别和抑制脆弱组件能有效提升毒性分类器在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，同时揭示了模型训练中存在的公平性和鲁棒性差距，为更包容的模型开发提供了指导。

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

TL;DR: 提出CBDT解码方法，通过使用领域数据示例来估计期望效用，结合MBR解码在多个翻译和图像字幕任务中表现优于传统MAP和MBR解码


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR解码依赖于从文本生成模型中采样的文本，难以正确捕获域外知识或信息，需要解决这一问题

Method: 提出基于案例的决策理论（CBDT）解码，使用领域数据示例来估计期望效用，并与MBR解码相结合

Result: 在7个领域De-En和Ja↔En翻译任务以及MSCOCO和nocaps数据集的图像字幕任务中，MBR+CBDT组合解码优于MBR解码

Conclusion: CBDT解码不仅比MAP解码生成更高质量的文本，而且与MBR解码结合后能进一步提升性能，特别是在处理域外知识方面

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

Motivation: 现有时间推理数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖且主要关注当代事件，需要构建更全面的历史时间推理基准来评估大语言模型的能力。

Method: 从维基百科时间线页面和文章信息框中提取历史事件，构建多语言数据库，并设计包含6种时间推理任务的问答基准来评估语言模型。

Result: GPT4o在所有答案类型和语言中表现最佳，Gemma-2在小型语言模型中表现最好。数据库提供了前所未有的历史深度和语言广度覆盖。

Conclusion: HistoryBank为推进多语言和时间感知的自然语言理解提供了全面资源，代码和数据集将在论文接受后公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别图像作为一般概念的实例，而不仅仅是识别对象及其关系。本文旨在研究VLM的概念抽象能力程度，并探索编码高层次概念信息的策略。

Method: 引入分组图像-标题数据集MAGIC，使用新型对比损失技术（包括外部对比损失和内部损失），通过分组对比学习诱导模型编码图像-标题组中共有的信息。

Result: 实验表明，这种训练方法使CLEAR GLASS模型在抽象概念识别方面相比SOTA模型有所改进，概念抽象能力作为涌现能力出现。

Conclusion: 通过分组对比学习技术，VLM能够获得概念抽象能力，模型能够为每个图像-标题组创建更接近潜在语义空间中高层次概念的语义表示。

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的'自下而上'数据驱动框架，通过'检索优先、聚类构建结构'策略，先建立知识边界再进行生成规划，有效解决了长文本生成中的事实准确性和内容碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有'自上而下'方法在生成假设或大纲后再检索证据，容易导致模型计划与可用知识脱节，造成内容碎片化和事实不准确。需要一种能够严格约束生成内容、确保可追溯性的新方法。

Method: 采用'检索优先获取知识，聚类构建结构'策略：首先从知识库进行详尽迭代检索，然后使用无监督聚类算法将检索到的文档组织成不同的'知识簇'，这些簇为后续层次化大纲和最终文档内容的生成提供数据驱动的基础。

Result: 在14B和32B参数模型上的实验结果表明，该方法达到或超过了最先进基线的性能，在需要高保真度和结构连贯性的知识约束场景中展现出独特优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成可靠、结构化的长文档提供了有效范式，为在高风险、知识密集型领域中构建更稳健的LLM应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

Method: 采用多种策略对齐阿拉伯语和马耳他语文本数据，包括不同音译方案和机器翻译方法，并开发了新的能更好表示马耳他语正字法的音译系统。

Result: 研究表明阿拉伯语为基础的增强技术能显著提升马耳他语NLP任务的性能，在单语和多语模型评估中都显示出积极效果。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语资源通过适当的跨语言增强技术可以有效支持马耳他语NLP，为解决低资源语言处理问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

Motivation: 多媒体内容的快速增长需要有效的多媒体事件抽取系统，但大型视觉语言模型在此任务中的应用潜力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 在M2E2数据集上系统评估代表性LVLMs（DeepSeek-VL2和Qwen-VL系列），涵盖纯文本、纯图像和跨媒体子任务，采用few-shot提示和微调两种设置进行评估。

Conclusion: LVLMs在M2E2任务中展现出潜力但仍面临语义精确性、定位和跨模态基础等持续挑战，这些是推进M2E2能力的关键障碍。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM问题难度估计方法依赖重复采样、辅助模型或微调，计算成本高且可能影响通用性，需要更高效准确的估计方法

Method: 将token级生成过程建模为马尔可夫链，定义值函数来基于隐藏状态估计预期输出质量，仅利用初始隐藏状态即可进行难度估计

Result: 在文本和多模态任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在难度估计方面 consistently 优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅基于LLM隐藏表示实现高效准确的难度估计，并可应用于指导自适应推理策略，以更少的生成标记实现更高的推理效率

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

Conclusion: 通过从零训练、专门的数据集设计和创新的训练技术，成功解决了LLM与嵌入模型之间的差距问题，证明了专门优化的嵌入模型的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

TL;DR: 提出了针对推理任务的训练免费、基于图的置信度估计方法，通过将推理路径建模为有向图并利用图属性来改进LLM的置信度估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的置信度估计方法主要针对事实问答任务，在推理任务上泛化能力不足，需要专门针对推理任务设计置信度估计方法

Method: 将推理路径建模为有向图，利用图的中心性、路径收敛性和路径加权等属性来估计置信度，无需训练

Result: 在两个大型语言模型和三个推理数据集上的实验表明，该方法改进了置信度估计，并在两个下游任务上提升了性能

Conclusion: 基于图的置信度估计方法能够有效提升LLM在推理任务上的可靠性，为LLM的可靠部署提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA
tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化工作流程生成提供了验证技术方案，并为实证研究科学范式演变提供了新颖的过程导向视角

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReLoRA在小型语言模型(11M-66M参数)预训练中的系统研究表明，其性能通常不如标准训练，且模型越大差距越明显，低秩更新策略难以直接迁移到SLM预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ReLoRA在小型语言模型预训练中的表现，探索参数高效方法在低计算成本环境下的适用性。

Method: 通过对11M-66M参数的小型语言模型进行系统研究，评估ReLoRA在损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP等指标上的表现，并进行消融实验和学习动态分析。

Result: ReLoRA在损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP等指标上普遍表现不如标准训练，且随着模型规模增大差距更加明显；学习动态分析显示ReLoRA会加剧小模型的秩不足问题。

Conclusion: 低秩更新策略可能难以直接迁移到小型语言模型预训练中，需要在低计算环境下进行更多研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的发展为文化感知语言任务提供了可能，需要超越字面翻译来适应不同文化的口味偏好和文化特定的风味描述

Method: 构建首个包含8k中文和16k英文评论的平行语料库，使用神经机器翻译基线和最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试，提出文化接近性、文化中立性和文化真实性三个评估标准

Result: 分析显示当前模型难以捕捉文化细微差别，特别是在跨文化翻译葡萄酒描述时表现不佳

Conclusion: 这突显了翻译模型在处理文化内容时的挑战和局限性，需要进一步改进文化适应能力

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有坐姿监测系统识别粒度粗糙，缺乏语义表达能力，无法提供个性化反馈，导致长期肌肉骨骼疾病和生理功能障碍

Method: 包含三个核心模块：高斯鲁棒传感器嵌入模块（空间分块和局部噪声扰动）、提示驱动的跨模态对齐模块（通过多头交叉注意力将传感器嵌入重编程到LLM语义空间）、多上下文提示模块（融合特征级、结构级、统计级和语义级上下文信息）

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果

Conclusion: SitLLM框架通过多模态融合和LLM技术，能够实现更精细的坐姿理解和个性化的健康导向响应生成

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域应用受限，主要原因是领域特定训练数据的稀缺性和复杂性。特别是在海事领域，手动标注数据成本高昂且不可行。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和o3-mini作为一次性教师，将32亿条AIS船舶追踪记录转化为21,543个合成问答对，然后对Qwen2.5-7B模型进行微调，避免过拟合并确保准确推理。

Result: 微调后的模型在海事任务上达到75%的准确率，相比使用更大模型进行推理，成本大幅降低261倍，证明了小模型经过适当微调可以达到与大模型相似的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业AI应用的合成数据集生成提供了可复现的框架，在手动标注不可行的领域具有重要应用价值，特别是在海事安全、安防操作和船舶交通管理系统等领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成符合复杂定性目标（如教学合理性）的输出方面存在挑战，传统强化学习方法依赖缓慢的LLM评估或脆弱的基于关键词的指标，无法捕捉高质量解释的语义本质

Method: 在GRPO框架中引入小型高效的编码器变换器作为语义奖励模型，基于生成解释与真实参考之间的余弦相似度提供密集语义奖励信号，应用于意大利医学院入学考试训练任务

Result: 与强大的SFT基线相比，使用语义奖励的GRPO显著提高了解释的忠实性和清晰度

Conclusion: 在复杂生成任务中使用轻量级编码器模型进行细致奖励塑形具有强大效果

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

TL;DR: PLAP框架通过语言规划和参数化技能执行，解决了LLM智能体在长时域环境中的落地挑战，在MicroRTS游戏中表现优异，超越了80%的基线智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体方法存在两个问题：直接生成底层动作不可靠，而高层任务规划又依赖专家经验来转换为具体动作序列。需要一种既能利用LLM规划能力又能可靠执行的方法。

Method: PLAP框架包含三个核心组件：环境特定的参数化技能库、LLM驱动的技能规划器、将参数化技能转换为可执行动作序列的技能执行器。

Result: GPT-4o驱动的PLAP在零样本设置下超越80%基线智能体，Qwen2-72B驱动的PLAP在少样本设置下超越了顶级脚本智能体CoacAI。还建立了LLM长时域技能规划能力排行榜。

Conclusion: PLAP框架有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂对抗性长时域环境中的落地问题，证明了语言规划与参数化技能执行的结合策略的优越性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSAD是一种基于隐藏信号分析的幻觉检测框架，通过分析自回归生成过程中隐藏表示的时域动态，在频域提取特征，相比现有方法在多个基准测试中提升超过10个百分点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法存在局限性：事实性检查受限于外部知识覆盖范围，静态隐藏状态分析无法捕捉推理动态中的偏差，导致效果和鲁棒性有限

Method: HSAD通过跨层采样激活构建隐藏层信号，应用快速傅里叶变换(FFT)获得频域表示，提取最强非直流频率分量作为频谱特征，并利用LLMs的自回归特性确定最佳观测点

Result: 在包括TruthfulQA在内的多个基准测试中，HSAD相比之前的最先进方法实现了超过10个百分点的改进

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程建模与频域分析相结合，HSAD为LLMs中的鲁棒幻觉检测建立了新范式

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现过度提示（over-prompting）现象：在大型语言模型中使用过多示例反而会降低性能，挑战了传统少样本学习的认知。通过实验确定了不同LLM的最优示例数量，在软件需求分类任务上超越现有方法1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中过度提示现象，挑战传统少样本学习认为更多相关示例总是有益的假设，特别是在软件工程和需求分析领域。

Method: 使用三种标准少样本选择方法（随机采样、语义嵌入、TF-IDF向量），在多个LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-3.5-turbo等）上进行评估，通过逐步增加TF-IDF选择的分层少样本示例数量来确定最优数量。

Result: 实验发现过度添加领域特定示例会降低某些LLM性能，确定了每个LLM的最优示例数量，在功能和非功能需求分类任务上超越最先进方法1%。

Conclusion: 过度提示确实存在，需要为不同LLM确定最优示例数量，结合方法可以用更少示例获得更好性能，避免过度提示问题。

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在人格特质识别方面表现有限，所有评估方法与大五人格真实评分的皮尔逊相关系数均低于0.26，表明当前模型与心理学构念的对齐度不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在情感支持和心理咨询等需要心理理解的应用中部署增多，需要评估其在生态有效对话环境中解释人类人格特质的能力，此前研究主要使用离散标签和社交媒体数据，缺乏对连续真实人格评估的对齐研究。

Method: 引入包含半结构化访谈记录和验证性连续大五人格评分的新基准，系统评估三种范式：1) GPT-4.1 Mini的零样本和思维链提示；2) RoBERTa和Meta-LLaMA的LoRA微调；3) 使用BERT和OpenAI文本嵌入的回归分析。

Result: 所有模型预测与真实人格特质的相关性均低于0.26，思维链提示相比零样本提升有限，表明人格推断更多依赖潜在语义表征而非显式推理。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs与复杂人类属性的对齐面临挑战，需要未来研究关注特质特异性提示、上下文感知建模和对齐导向的微调方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图表问答任务中经常关注不相关区域，与人类注意力模式存在差异，导致可解释性和准确性降低，需要研究如何利用人类注视模式来改进模型。

Method: 构建ChartGaze眼动追踪数据集捕获人类图表推理时的注视模式，提出基于人类注视的注意力优化方法，将图像-文本注意力与人类注视点对齐。

Result: 该方法在多个模型上实现了最高2.56个百分点的准确性提升，同时改善了注意力对齐效果。

Conclusion: 人类注视信息可以有效提升图表相关LVLMs的推理质量和可解释性，展示了将人类认知模式融入模型优化的潜力。

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的环境构建框架AgentScaler，通过自动创建多样化模拟环境来增强大语言模型的函数调用能力，采用两阶段微调策略显著提升了智能体在多个基准测试中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界API需要精确、鲁棒的函数调用智能，而智能体能力的广度与其训练环境的多样性密切相关。为了推进通用智能体智能，需要解决如何规模化构建环境和如何有效训练智能体能力这两个核心挑战。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展框架，自动构建完全模拟的异构环境，系统性地拓宽函数调用场景空间。采用两阶段智能体微调策略：首先赋予基础智能体能力，然后针对特定领域进行专业化训练。

Result: 在tau-bench、tau2-Bench和ACEBench等智能体基准测试上的广泛实验表明，训练出的AgentScaler模型显著增强了模型的函数调用能力。

Conclusion: 通过规模化环境构建和有效的两阶段训练策略，成功提升了智能体的函数调用智能，为实际应用中的大语言模型部署提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

TL;DR: WebWeaver是一个双智能体框架，通过模拟人类研究过程解决开放深度研究问题，采用动态规划与分层写作的方法，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在处理开放深度研究时存在静态研究流程和一次性生成范式的双重限制，导致长上下文失效和幻觉问题，需要更接近人类研究过程的解决方案。

Method: 提出双智能体框架：规划器动态循环迭代证据获取和提纲优化，生成基于证据的全面提纲；写作者执行分层检索和写作过程，逐部分撰写报告。

Result: 在DeepResearch Bench、DeepConsult和DeepResearchGym等主要OEDR基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 自适应规划和聚焦合成对于生成高质量、可靠且结构良好的报告至关重要，验证了以人为中心的迭代方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

TL;DR: ReSum是一种新的LLM网络代理范式，通过周期性上下文摘要克服ReAct等方法的上下文窗口限制，实现无限探索，在多个基准测试中平均比ReAct提升4.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的网络代理在处理复杂查询时因上下文窗口限制而无法完成搜索的问题，特别是涉及多实体、复杂关系和高不确定性的任务

Method: 提出ReSum范式，通过定期将交互历史转换为紧凑的推理状态来维持对先前发现的感知；开发ReSum-GRPO方法，结合分段轨迹训练和优势广播来训练代理适应基于摘要的推理

Result: 在三个基准测试中，ReSum相比ReAct平均绝对提升4.5%，经过ReSum-GRPO训练后进一步提升达8.2%；WebResummer-30B仅用1K训练样本就在BrowseComp-zh上达到33.3% Pass@1，在BrowseComp-en上达到18.3%

Conclusion: ReSum通过上下文摘要有效解决了LLM网络代理的上下文限制问题，ReSum-GRPO训练方法显著提升了代理性能，在有限训练数据下超越了现有开源网络代理

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究批判性评估了LLM激活描述方法，发现这些方法在没有访问目标模型内部信息的情况下也能在基准测试中成功，表明现有数据集不适合评估此类方法。实验显示描述结果往往反映的是描述器LLM的参数知识而非目标LLM的激活状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证激活描述方法是否能真正提供目标模型内部工作机制的特权知识，还是仅仅传递了输入信息，以评估这类解释性方法的有效性。

Method: 在先前工作使用的数据集上评估流行描述方法，进行控制实验分析描述结果与目标模型激活的关系，以及描述器LLM参数知识的影响。

Result: 描述方法在无需访问目标模型内部的情况下就能通过基准测试；控制实验显示描述结果主要反映描述器LLM的参数知识而非目标模型的真实激活状态。

Conclusion: 需要针对性的基准测试和实验控制来严格评估描述方法是否能提供对LLM操作的有意义洞察，现有方法存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于U-Mamba架构的人机协同机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割算法的泛化能力，在乳腺MRI数据上取得了优异的分割性能，并展示了在临床规划和患者教育中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型在处理多样化数据集时泛化能力不足，需要开发能够跨数据集和成像场景通用的准确分割算法，以支持有效的术前规划和3D解剖重建。

Method: 采用三阶段处理流程：1）乳腺MRI数据的匿名化和手动分割；2）共配准和全乳腺、纤维腺体组织及肿瘤的分割；3）使用ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化。核心是使用U-Mamba架构的人机协同方法优化分割结果。

Result: U-Mamba模型表现出色：T1加权图像上全器官DSC为0.97±0.013，纤维腺体组织为0.96±0.024，肿瘤为0.82±0.12。生成的3D重建能够可视化复杂解剖特征，临床访谈显示改善了术前规划、术中导航和决策支持。

Conclusion: 这种人机协同机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划效果，并通过3D可视化提升了患者教育和沟通效果，促进了共享决策制定。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络自动分割TRISO核燃料颗粒的微观图像层，以替代繁琐的人工分析，提高分析效率和客观性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRISO颗粒燃料在辐照过程中会发生内核膨胀和缓冲层致密化等现象，传统人工显微镜分析数千个颗粒既繁琐又主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 构建包含2000多张辐照后TRISO颗粒微观图像的数据集，使用RU-Net、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN架构进行自动图像分割

Result: 基于RU-Net的模型在IoU指标上表现最佳，能够显著加速TRISO颗粒截面分析并提高分割结果的客观性

Conclusion: CNN方法可以有效自动化TRISO燃料颗粒的微观图像分析，减少人工劳动并提高分析结果的客观性和效率

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前养分管理方法需要冗长分析，无法实时优化；成像技术虽然快速但计算密集，难以在资源受限环境下部署。需要开发灵活高效的方法来实现农业可持续性。

Method: 使用多光谱成像数据，构建分层管道：1）自编码器用于异常检测和早期预警；2）比较两种状态估计模块：植被指数特征+随机森林（低复杂度）和原始图像+视觉变换器（高复杂度）。

Result: 异常检测效率高（移植后9天检测到73%的T3样本），能耗远低于浪费氮的体现能量。状态估计显示权衡：ViT在磷和钙估计上表现更好（R2 0.61 vs 0.58, 0.48 vs 0.35），但能耗更高。

Conclusion: 该模块化管道为边缘诊断和农业可持续发展提供了实用机会，实现了准确性和能耗之间的灵活平衡。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

Motivation: 幽默理解是社会智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型(LMMs)来说仍然是一个重大挑战。需要建立一个专门的基准来评估LMMs在多模态幽默理解和叙事推理方面的能力。

Method: 引入PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个经过标注的多格漫画，用于评估LMMs的多模态幽默解释和叙事序列识别能力。通过实验测试多个最先进的LMMs模型性能。

Result: 实验结果显示当前最先进模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%的准确率，远低于人类表现水平，表明现有模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: PixelHumor通过提供评估多模态上下文和叙事推理的严格框架，旨在推动开发能够更好地参与自然、具有社会意识交互的LMMs模型，填补当前模型在幽默理解方面的能力空白。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

Conclusion: 在线人-物交互处理是一个重要但被忽视的问题，提出的OnlineHOI框架有效解决了离线方法在在线场景中的性能瓶颈

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏置(SB)与图像分类任务性能的关系，提出了频率感知的SB测量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务性能存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置(SB)影响泛化能力，但现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，缺乏对大模型SB的测量及其在图像分类任务中作用的理解。

Method: 提出频率感知的SB测量方法，在CLIP模型上验证该方法，并分析SB与多种图像分类任务（零样本和微调）性能的关系。

Result: 新测量方法比现有方法更具信息性和一致性；强SB与OOD泛化性能正相关，但与对抗鲁棒性关系不同，表明模型归纳偏置与任务特征对齐的重要性。

Conclusion: SB测量需要针对大模型设计新方法，模型归纳偏置应与目标任务特征对齐以获得最佳性能，不同任务需要不同程度的SB。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

TL;DR: GraphDerm是一个基于群体图的框架，首次在ISIC规模上将图神经网络应用于皮肤镜检查，融合图像、毫米级校准和元数据，在皮肤镜多分类任务中显著优于仅使用图像的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的皮肤镜AI系统通常仅依赖图像数据，忽略了患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和物理尺度信息，而这些信息对于几何分析和准确分类至关重要。

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过轻量级1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含图像特征、元数据和几何相似性的群体图，采用谱GNN进行半监督节点分类。

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice分数达0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型AUC达到0.9812，稀疏图（使用约25%边）保持AUC 0.9788，显著优于仅图像基线的0.9440。

Conclusion: 将校准尺度、病变几何和元数据统一在群体图中，相比仅使用图像的流程在ISIC-2019上获得显著提升。稀疏图保持接近最优精度，表明可高效部署。基于尺度的图AI是皮肤镜决策支持的有前景方向。

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了位置感知文本图像机器翻译(PATIMT)任务，构建了包含10个真实场景的基准测试集PATIMTBench，通过自适应OCR优化流程和人工标注测试集，使紧凑型大视觉语言模型在两个子任务上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本图像机器翻译研究主要关注全图像文本翻译，忽略了边界框定位和有限场景覆盖的问题，需要支持细粒度、保持布局的翻译任务。

Method: 提出位置感知TIMT任务，包含区域特定翻译和全图像接地翻译两个子任务；构建PATIMTBench基准数据集，采用自适应图像OCR优化流程选择合适OCR工具并优化文本丰富图像结果；构建1200个高质量人工标注测试集。

Result: 经过数据微调后，紧凑型大视觉语言模型在两个子任务上都达到了最先进的性能，实验结果表明训练数据具有良好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PATIMT任务具有重要实用价值，提出的基准数据集和方法有效支持了细粒度、布局保持的文本图像翻译，为相关研究提供了可靠评估基础。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

TL;DR: 提出SimMemDA框架解决SAR与光学图像间的跨模态域适应问题，通过相似性引导和记忆引导机制提升船迹检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的船迹特征抽象且噪声多，标注困难；光学图像视觉线索清晰但存在域偏移问题，需要解决跨模态域适应挑战。

Method: 使用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成伪SAR图像，设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制，引入特征置信度记忆库和K近邻置信度加权融合策略，结合区域混合训练增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明SimMemDA方法能够提高跨模态船迹检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效可行，成功解决了光学到SAR图像的域适应问题，提升了船迹检测性能。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Amplifier Air-Transformer方法，通过数据驱动和物理引导的深度学习，生成美国本土2公里分辨率、每小时更新的无缝气温数据，验证精度达1.93°C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气象站提供连续监测但空间覆盖有限，卫星提供广域覆盖但存在云层遮挡问题，缺乏时空无缝的气温数据源。

Method: 使用神经网络重建GOES-16被云遮挡的地表温度数据，结合年温度周期编码和ERA5温度放大，再通过另一神经网络将地表温度转换为气温，并采用深度集成学习进行不确定性估计。

Result: 基于77.7亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站记录(2018-2024年)构建和测试，在站点验证中达到1.93°C的每小时气温制图精度。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了地表温度重建和气温预测的流程化，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率的气温无缝监测。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在动物重识别任务中，后处理度量学习的效果高度依赖于骨干网络嵌入的初始质量和领域特异性。领域专用模型比通用模型更容易通过度量学习进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在动物重识别任务中，通用预训练模型与领域专用模型在后处理度量学习方面的表现差异，以及度量学习对不同类型骨干网络的影响。

Method: 使用DINOv2（通用模型）和MegaDescriptor（领域专用模型）作为骨干网络，采用K近邻分类器进行个体识别，并比较三元组学习投影头对两种模型的性能提升效果。

Result: 三元组学习对专用模型MegaDescriptor提升0.13分，但对通用模型DINOv2仅提升0.03分（基于BAKS和BAUS平均值）。通用模型的流形结构更难针对细粒度任务进行重塑。

Conclusion: 通用预训练特征在专业化、小数据量的重识别任务中存在关键局限性，领域特异性预训练对于此类任务至关重要。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at

Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限的边缘设备上部署困难，需要探索模型压缩和适配策略以支持高效推理。

Method: 基于GhostNetV3架构开发GhostNetV3-Small变体，并比较传统知识蒸馏、教师助理和教师集成等多种蒸馏技术。

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著优于原版GhostNetV3，但所有蒸馏策略都导致准确率下降。

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，架构适配比蒸馏技术更有效，需要在低分辨率领域进一步研究有效的模型设计和先进蒸馏技术。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于无人机的生物多样性和保护监测提供了实用指导，推荐在具体部署场景中使用原始影像，在需要跨域泛化时使用正射影像，并通过树冠中心标注提升定位精度。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了MechBench数据集和DYNAMO模型，用于从几何形状预测机械装配体的耦合运动，特别是在齿轮等复杂机械系统中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对日常铰接物体的运动预测依赖于简化的运动学结构或关节标注，但机械装配体（如齿轮）的运动来源于几何耦合（啮合齿或对齐轴），难以仅从几何形状推断关系运动。

Method: 引入MechBench数据集（693个合成齿轮装配体）和DYNAMO模型，这是一个依赖感知的神经网络模型，能够从分割的CAD点云直接预测每个零件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: 实验表明DYNAMO优于强基线方法，在不同齿轮配置下实现了准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了一个新颖的系统框架，用于数据驱动的CAD装配体中耦合机械运动学习。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet是准确高效的田间部署解决方案，为自动化棉花采摘和高通量表型分析提供可靠技术支撑

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Conclusion: TSDF框架成功解决了青光眼预后中变长序列处理和有限数据集训练的挑战，为临床实践提供了灵活高效的解决方案

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该训练方案成功减少了重建与生成分布之间的差异，显著提升了生成质量，为图像生成模型的分词器设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达虽然成本低、耐用且不受环境条件影响，但角分辨率较差。现有方法缺乏标准化的基础模型和大数据集，通常需要从小数据集从头训练任务特定模型。

Method: 收集了100万样本（29小时）的最大原始雷达数据集，训练了4D单芯片雷达的基础模型GRT，使用原始雷达数据而非有损表示。

Result: GRT能够泛化到不同场景，可针对不同任务进行微调，每10倍数据量提升20%性能。使用原始数据相当于10倍训练数据量的提升。

Conclusion: 估计需要约1亿样本（3000小时）数据才能充分发挥GRT的潜力，为毫米波雷达感知提供了有效的通用基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在噪声条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估模型在各种扰动下的表现。

Method: 使用包含光照变化、运动模糊和压缩伪影的受控扰动，通过词汇指标（BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE、CIDEr）和基于神经网络的句子嵌入相似度来衡量语义对齐。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

TL;DR: IG-CAM是一种新的弱监督语义分割方法，通过实例引导和影响函数集成，在仅使用图像级标注的情况下实现了82.3%的mIoU性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有弱监督语义分割方法在对象边界定位不精确和只关注最具判别性区域的问题，避免昂贵的像素级标注需求。

Method: 提出IG-CAM方法，包含三个关键创新：实例引导细化、影响函数集成和多尺度边界增强，使用实例级线索和影响函数生成高质量边界感知定位图。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,

Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多标签联邦学习中的特征分布对齐和表示学习问题，在挑战性场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

Conclusion: Agent4FaceForgery框架通过模拟人类伪造创作过程，成功解决了训练数据生态无效性问题，为人脸伪造检测提供了更有效的训练数据生成方法。

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在HOI检测中占主导地位，但无法显式建模关系结构，而GNN天生更适合建模人-物对之间的关系

Method: 设计四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多级特征交互机制，利用多级视觉和语言特征增强人-物对间的信息传播

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中达到SOTA性能，与更先进的目标检测器集成时获得显著性能提升，并在稀有和非稀有类别间保持有效平衡

Conclusion: GNN-based的MGNM方法通过显式建模关系结构，有效提升了HOI检测性能，证明了图神经网络在该任务中的优势

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

*YiTong Liu,TianZhu Liu,YanFeng GU*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于EVA02的多尺度频率注意力融合方法，通过多频率分支块和频率感知空间注意力模块，有效解决跨视角地理定位中的特征提取问题，在多个基准测试中取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨视角地理定位中往往忽略空间和语义信息，难以处理显著的外观变化和提取判别性特征

Method: EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion (MFAF)方法，包含Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB)和Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA)模块，分别捕获多尺度频率特征和自适应关注关键区域

Result: 在University-1652、SUES-200和Dense-UAV等基准测试中表现出色，在无人机定位和导航任务中均取得竞争优势

Conclusion: MFAF方法通过频率域特征提取和注意力机制，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

### [81] [A Comparative Study of YOLOv8 to YOLOv11 Performance in Underwater Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12682)
*Gordon Hung,Ivan Felipe Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对YOLOv8到YOLOv11四个版本在海洋图像检测任务上的性能进行了系统比较，发现YOLOv9后准确率饱和，而YOLOv10在嵌入式AUV部署中提供最佳的速度-准确率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主航行器(AUVs)依赖计算机视觉系统进行海洋任务，但水下图像存在光线衰减、浑浊和类别不平衡等问题，且AUV计算资源有限，需要评估最新YOLO检测器在海洋领域的性能。

Method: 使用两个公开数据集（珊瑚疾病数据集和鱼类物种数据集），创建四种训练规模，在相同超参数下训练YOLOv8-s、YOLOv9-s、YOLOv10-s和YOLOv11-s，评估精度、召回率、mAP、推理时间等指标，并进行Grad-CAM可视化分析。

Result: 在两个数据集上，准确率在YOLOv9后达到饱和，而推理速度持续提升。YOLOv10在速度和准确率之间提供了最佳平衡，适合嵌入式AUV部署。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个近期YOLO变体在水下图像上的受控比较，表明YOLOv10是嵌入式AUV部署的最佳选择，并提供了可复现的基准和代码库以加速未来海洋视觉研究。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Motivation: 解决现有立体匹配算法因训练数据多样性不足而导致的泛化性能受限问题，为自动驾驶提供更鲁棒的深度感知系统。

Method: 基于CARLA模拟器构建高保真合成立体数据集，包含多种相机配置（基线、视角、传感器位置）和环境条件（光照变化、天气效果、道路几何）。

Result: 在四个标准评估数据集（KITTI2012、KITTI2015、Middlebury、ETH3D）上的跨域实验表明，使用StereoCarla训练的模型在泛化精度上优于使用11个现有数据集的模型，并且在多数据集训练中显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: StereoCarla为在真实、多样和可控环境下开发和评估立体算法提供了有价值的基准，有助于构建更鲁棒的自动驾驶深度感知系统。

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic
stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on
the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under
realistic, diverse, and controllable settings, facilitating more robust depth
perception systems for autonomous vehicles. Code can be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为SmokeBench的真实世界监控图像去烟基准数据集，包含不同场景设置和烟雾浓度的配对图像，用于推进火灾场景中的图像去烟研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期火灾场景（点火后0-15分钟）是紧急干预的关键时间窗口，但烟雾会严重降低监控系统的可见度，影响应急响应和救援操作。由于缺乏大规模真实世界的配对无烟/有烟图像数据集，烟雾去除算法的发展受到限制。

Method: 构建了一个真实世界的监控图像去烟基准数据集SmokeBench，包含在不同场景设置和烟雾浓度下捕获的精确对齐的退化图像和干净图像对，支持监督学习和严格评估。

Result: 在数据集上对各种去烟方法进行了全面的基准测试实验，为推进真实世界火灾场景中鲁棒实用的图像去烟提供了宝贵基础。

Conclusion: SmokeBench数据集已公开发布，可用于下载，为解决火灾早期烟雾遮挡问题提供了重要的数据资源支持。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

TL;DR: 本文提出RIS-FUSION框架，通过联合优化统一图像融合和参考图像分割任务，解决了文本驱动红外-可见光图像融合中缺乏目标对齐监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动红外和可见光图像融合方法缺乏有效的任务来监督和评估文本输入对融合结果的贡献程度。作者发现参考图像分割(RIS)和文本驱动融合具有共同目标：突出文本所指的对象。

Method: 提出RIS-FUSION级联框架，包含LangGatedFusion模块将文本特征注入融合主干网络以增强语义对齐。同时构建了MM-RIS大规模基准数据集，包含12.5k训练和3.5k测试三元组（红外-可见光图像对、分割掩码和参考表达式）。

Result: 实验表明RIS-FUSION达到最先进性能，在mIoU指标上超过现有方法11%以上。

Conclusion: 通过统一融合和RIS任务的联合优化，有效提升了文本驱动图像融合的性能，并提供了大规模多模态基准数据集支持后续研究。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

TL;DR: DeFA方法通过解构-重构框架和去偏策略，解决组合零样本学习中的特征纠缠和长尾分布问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习面临属性和对象特征纠缠以及现实数据长尾分布的挑战，受神经科学发现（想象与感知共享神经过程）启发，提出特征增强方法

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，包含解构-重构框架进行特征增强，结合去偏策略，利用已见属性和对象的先验知识合成高质量组合特征

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上，DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置中都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA通过神经科学启发的特征增强和去偏策略，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的关键挑战，实现了优异的组合泛化能力

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，专门解决视觉-语言模型中视觉和语言处理不对称的问题，通过三种专家组实现更好的跨模态交互和上下文保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言模态时面临不对称性挑战，视觉信息具有空间完整性而语言需要保持序列上下文，导致深层语言专家逐渐失去上下文基础并过度依赖参数知识。

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三种专家组：模态内专家处理特定模态特征，双曲跨模态专家处理分层跨模态交互，证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏见并保持上下文基础。

Result: 实验显示AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别提升26.58%和15.45%的准确率，同时比密集模型减少25.45%的激活参数。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言处理的不对称性，有效解决了跨模态交互中的挑战，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观测环境，无法捕捉长时程推理和记忆利用在部分可观测和动态变化下的挑战

Method: 引入局部可观测迷宫导航和match-2消除两个动态空间基准，提出基于主观经验的记忆机制进行跨任务经验迁移和验证

Result: 实验显示基准揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性

Conclusion: 为未来方法学进展提供了全面的评估平台

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen提出了一种新颖的球面投影表示方法，通过将3D几何信息投影到2D图像域，解决了传统多视角扩散方法中的视角不一致问题，同时能够表示复杂内部结构和拓扑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视图3D生成模型采用多视角扩散先验，但存在视角不一致问题，且无法准确表示复杂内部结构或非平凡拓扑。需要一种能够同时保证一致性、灵活性和效率的新方法。

Method: 通过将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为紧凑的结构化多层2D球面投影(SP)表示，在图像域进行操作，直接继承强大的2D扩散先验，支持高效微调。

Result: 大量实验表明，SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SPGen通过创新的球面投影表示，成功解决了单视图3D生成中的视角一致性问题，同时提供了更好的灵活性和计算效率，为3D生成领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Defense2Attack是一种新颖的视觉语言模型越狱方法，通过将防御机制融入攻击流程，显著提高了越狱效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型(VLMs)能力强大，但存在越狱攻击漏洞。现有越狱方法的效果和效率仍有提升空间，研究发现将弱防御融入攻击流程可以显著增强越狱性能。

Method: 提出Defense2Attack方法，包含三个核心组件：(1)视觉优化器：嵌入具有肯定和鼓励语义的通用对抗扰动；(2)文本优化器：使用防御风格提示优化输入；(3)红队后缀生成器：通过强化微调增强越狱效果。

Result: 在4个VLMs和4个安全基准测试上的实验表明，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中实现了优越的越狱性能，超越了需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为越狱视觉语言模型提供了新的视角，证明了利用防御模式指导越狱提示设计的有效性。

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高斯泼溅方法采用无差别属性分配导致梯度冲突，需要更有效的高斯管理策略来提升重建质量和效率。

Method: 提出动态激活球谐函数或法向量的致密化策略，基于梯度幅度自适应调整SH阶数，并进行任务解耦剪枝来移除对重建任务影响最小的高斯。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面均优于最先进方法，使用显著更少的参数实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法具有模型无关性，可无缝集成到其他框架中，在提升性能的同时减少模型大小。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析ConvNeXt架构深度可分离网络中的8个主关键滤波器，提出基于高斯核离散模拟的尺度空间滤波器模型，证明了学习到的滤波器可以用离散尺度空间滤波器良好近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度可分离深度网络中学习到的感受野滤波器的数学特性，验证这些滤波器是否可以通过可分离的空间滤波操作和高斯核离散模拟来建模。

Method: 首先计算学习滤波器的空间扩散度量（加权均值和方差），然后使用高斯核离散模拟的差分算子对聚类后的主关键滤波器进行建模，通过两种方式拟合模型：不同坐标方向的尺度参数和相同尺度参数，并使用空间方差相等或最小化l1/l2范数进行模型拟合。

Result: 理想化的感受野模型与学习滤波器在定性上表现出良好相似性，实验证明用理想化滤波器替换学习滤波器具有良好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中学习到的滤波器可以通过离散尺度空间滤波器很好地近似，这为理解深度网络中的特征学习提供了数学基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 本文研究多模态LLM与人类在评估文本生成图像质量时的差异，发现LLM在理解图像美学、解剖准确性等关键属性方面与人类存在显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动评估文本生成图像模型的方法主要依赖多模态LLM，但这些方法未能深入理解LLM如何利用与人类相关的概念（如图像风格、构图等）来进行整体质量评估

Method: 首先通过合成生成的图像对构建人类偏好数据集，分析图像质量属性间的相关性；然后对多模态LLM进行相同分析；最后针对每个图像质量属性生成高控制度的合成数据集进行深入研究

Result: 人类在判断图像质量时各属性间存在强相关性，而LLM的属性间关系较弱；人类能轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但LLM在某些属性（如解剖准确性）上学习判断较为困难

Conclusion: 多模态LLM与人类在图像感知方式上存在有趣差异，LLM在理解某些关键图像质量属性方面仍有局限，这为改进自动评估方法提供了重要见解

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

TL;DR: ReCOT是一个循环跨视角物体地理定位Transformer，将CVOGL任务重新定义为循环定位任务，通过可学习token和迭代注意力机制精确定位，结合SAM知识蒸馏和参考特征增强模块，在减少60%参数的同时达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角物体地理定位视为一次性检测任务，直接回归物体位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏错误纠正机制。

Method: 提出循环跨视角物体地理定位Transformer(ReCOT)，使用可学习token编码查询图像和提示嵌入的任务特定意图，通过迭代注意力机制精炼预测位置。引入SAM知识蒸馏策略传输分割先验知识，以及参考特征增强模块(RFEM)使用分层注意力强调物体相关区域。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中，ReCOT实现了最先进的性能，同时相比之前的SOTA方法减少了60%的参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架、知识蒸馏和特征增强模块，有效解决了跨视角物体地理定位中的噪声和错误纠正问题，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

TL;DR: A-TDOM是一种基于实时3D高斯溅射优化的近实时真数字正射影像图生成方法，能够在新图像获取后几秒内完成3DGS优化并渲染TDOM


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，存在延迟问题且质量可能因相机位姿不准、DSM不精确和场景遮挡而下降，无法满足实时应用需求

Method: 基于实时SfM计算每张新图像的位姿和稀疏点云，将新高斯点集成并优化到先前未见或粗略重建区域，结合正交溅射技术实现每次3DGS场更新后立即渲染

Result: 在多个基准测试中，A-TDOM能够以近实时方式主动渲染TDOM，每个新图像的3DGS优化仅需几秒钟，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和TDOM几何精度

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成的延迟问题，实现了近实时的高质量正射影像图生成，为实时地理空间应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: DyGLNet为临床医学图像分析提供了一个高效可靠的解决方案，在保持高分割精度的同时显著降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

TL;DR: 提出了BATR-FST方法，通过双层自适应token精炼机制提升Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的性能，在多个基准数据集上取得了优越结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在少样本学习中面临token级交互精炼困难、训练数据有限和归纳偏置不足的挑战，现有方法依赖不灵活的token匹配或简单相似性度量

Method: 采用两阶段方法：预训练阶段使用掩码图像建模获得可迁移的patch级表示；元微调阶段包含token聚类、不确定性感知token加权、双层注意力机制、图token传播和类分离惩罚

Result: 在三个基准少样本数据集上的广泛实验表明，BATR-FST在1-shot和5-shot场景中都取得了优越结果

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过有效的token精炼和归纳偏置保持，显著提升了transformer在少样本分类中的性能

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的高度异质性和变异性给精确亚型诊断带来挑战，现有方法未能有效利用放射科医生诊断工作流程中常用的多期相CECT的上下文信息。

Method: 提出双层次对比增强感知Mamba模块，包含新颖的空间和时间采样序列来探索病灶的期相内和期相间对比变化；引入相似性引导细化模块强调局部肿瘤区域的时间变化学习；设计空间互补集成器和多粒度融合模块来编码和聚合不同尺度的语义信息。

Result: 在包含270个临床病例的内部数据集上，区分胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)和胰腺神经内分泌肿瘤(PNETs)的准确率达到97.4%，AUC达到98.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了作为更准确、高效工具的潜力，能够有效利用多期相CECT数据进行胰腺肿瘤亚型分类。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文表示学习网络，通过整合功能推理和上下文提示来改进人-物交互检测，在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段方法在上下文建模方面存在不足，无法充分捕捉复杂的人-物交互关系，特别是涉及辅助工具的多变量关系

Method: 扩展传统HOI检测框架，引入三元组结构<人,工具,物体>来显式建模辅助对象的功能角色，使用可学习提示与视觉特征通过注意力机制进行整合

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集的大多数场景中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 通过上下文化表示学习和功能推理，能够更可靠地处理复杂、依赖上下文的交互关系，提升了HOI检测的效果

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 实验表明DH-Diff在多样性和真实性方面显著优于现有方法，并显著提升了下游异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DH-Diff框架有效解决了合成异常数据生成中的关键挑战，为制造业视觉检测提供了高质量的训练数据增强方案。

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低层特征，而深度学习方法虽然利用高层特征但往往牺牲规则性来捕捉复杂物体，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差。

Method: 训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，在推理时利用大规模预训练模型进行语义无关分割，确保超像素与物体掩码对齐，并能处理任何先验高层分割和不确定区域。

Result: 综合实验表明，SPAM在分割任务上定性和定量都优于最先进方法，成为各种应用的宝贵且鲁棒的工具。

Conclusion: SPAM提供了一个多功能框架，能够生成准确且规则的超像素分割，解决了现有方法在规则性和准确性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

Motivation: 传统线性注意力在压缩历史KV信息时采用均匀压缩方式，导致特征冗余和方向对齐丢失，造成性能差距

Method: 引入输入自适应的可学习门控机制选择性调制KV特征图的信息聚合，并提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法计算门控

Result: 在1280×1280分辨率下比PVT-T吞吐量提升1.76倍，GPU峰值内存减少2.69倍，ImageNet top-1准确率最高提升4.4%

Conclusion: SAGA通过选择性门控机制有效解决了线性注意力的低秩约束问题，实现了计算效率和模型性能的双重提升

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型受限于较小数据集规模，需要系统研究数据规模和预训练范式如何影响医疗场景下的性能表现，以理解持续预训练的价值。

Method: 使用单一机构的350万张胸部X光片，在保持计算资源和评估协议不变的情况下，对代表CLIP和DINOv2两种主要编码器范式的MedImageInsight和RAD-DINO进行持续预训练，评估分类、分割和放射报告生成任务。

Result: MI2在放射发现相关任务上扩展性更好，RAD-DINO在导管相关任务上更强；使用UniCL结合报告和结构化标签持续预训练MI2能提升性能；仅需3万张领域内样本即可在某些任务上超越开源基础模型。

Conclusion: 中心特定的持续预训练具有重要价值，医疗机构通过利用领域内数据可以获得显著的性能提升，不同编码器范式在不同医疗任务上各有优势。

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Conclusion: 通过结合基于不同感知方法的DISTS和VMAF指标，可以有效克服单一指标的局限性，实现更准确的NeRF生成图像质量评估。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

TL;DR: CCS是一种无需标注的度量标准，通过测试时数据增强和IoU重叠计算来评估目标检测器的空间一致性，作为可靠性的代理指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部署环境中评估目标检测模型具有挑战性，因为很难获得真实标注。需要一种无需标注的指标来持续监控和比较检测器在真实场景中的表现。

Method: 对每张图像应用测试时数据增强，收集增强视图上的预测边界框，使用IoU计算重叠度，通过最大重叠度的归一化和平均来度量空间一致性。

Result: 在Open Images和KITTI数据集上的控制实验中，CCS与F1分数、概率检测质量和最优校正成本的匹配度超过90%，适用于单阶段和两阶段检测器。

Conclusion: CCS为DevOps风格的目标检测器监控提供了稳健的基础，能够突出表现不佳的场景，实现无标注的持续评估。

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PENet是一个用于少样本3D点云语义分割的新框架，通过结合扩散模型的生成能力和传统监督学习，构建大容量原型来解决类内多样性和集合间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有原型方法在少样本3D点云分割中的两个关键挑战：类内多样性（单一原型无法覆盖类的全部变化）和集合间不一致性（支持集原型与查询特征空间不对齐）。

Method: 提出Prototype Expansion Network (PENet)，采用双流学习器架构：保持传统监督学习的Intrinsic Learner提取代表性特征，引入Diffusion Learner提供丰富可泛化特征。使用Prototype Assimilation Module通过推-拉交叉引导注意力块迭代对齐原型与查询空间，并通过Prototype Calibration Mechanism防止语义漂移。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet数据集上的大量实验表明，PENet在各种少样本设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用扩散模型的预训练条件编码器作为可泛化特征的新来源，PENet成功扩展了原型的表示范围，有效解决了少样本3D点云分割中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令式图像编辑方法对训练域外的用户指令泛化能力不足，限制了实际应用。需要解决真实世界用户指令的多样性问题。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型组织模型级编辑工具包，包含多样化模型和图像处理函数；采用三阶段渐进式强化学习方法，利用无标注开放域指令的反馈训练模型。

Result: 在GEdit-Bench和ImgBench上达到最先进性能，展现出对开放域指令的强大推理能力，并能直接使用新引入的编辑工具。

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过结合模型级工具包和强化学习，有效解决了指令式图像编辑的泛化问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified Flow模型虽然生成性能优于DDIM扩散模型，但在实际应用中面临反演精度低和注意力机制纠缠的问题，影响了源图像一致性和精确控制能力。

Method: 1) 基于Runge-Kutta微分方程求解器的高效高阶反演方法；2) 解耦扩散变换器注意力机制(DDTA)，将文本和图像注意力分离。

Result: 在图像重建和文本引导编辑任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在保真度和可编辑性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了Rectified Flow模型的两个主要挑战，显著提升了反演精度和语义控制能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is
available at https://github.com/wmchen/RKSovler_DDTA.

TL;DR: 提出MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO)框架，通过共享-特定解耦学习和协调梯度学习策略，解决手术三元组识别中的任务间和任务内优化冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术三元组识别面临长尾数据分布问题，现有方法存在任务间表示纠缠导致的优化冲突和类别不平衡引起的任务内优化冲突。

Method: 1) 共享-特定解耦学习方案分解表示；2) MLLM驱动的概率提示池增强视觉特征；3) 协调梯度学习策略重新平衡头尾类梯度。

Result: 在CholecT45和CholecT50数据集上的广泛实验证明了所提框架的优越性。

Conclusion: MEJO框架有效解决了手术三元组识别中的优化冲突问题，提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

Motivation: 现有工作缺乏对导航和对话的全面评估，需要开发一个要求通信至关重要的协作导航任务，其中向导必须推断导航者的位置。

Method: 收集并发布RAIN数据集（包含人-人对话和逼真环境中的导航轨迹），设计综合基准评估导航和对话性能，进行大量实验分析不同导航者和向导模型的影响。

Conclusion: DialNav任务和RAIN数据集为具身对话研究提供了重要贡献，公开发布的数据集、代码和评估框架将促进该领域的未来发展。

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了跨层视觉平滑（CLVS）方法，通过引入视觉记忆机制来维持大视觉语言模型对关键物体的持续关注，从而提升视觉理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型虽然能准确定位关键物体，但对这些物体的注意力往往很短暂。假设持续关注关键物体可以提升模型的视觉能力

Method: CLVS方法包含视觉记忆机制，在第一层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化记忆，后续层中联合考虑先前层的视觉记忆并迭代更新，使用不确定性作为视觉理解完成的指标来终止平滑过程

Result: 在四个基准测试和三个大视觉语言模型上的实验证实了方法的有效性和泛化性，CLVS在各种视觉理解任务上达到了最先进的性能，在关系和属性理解方面有显著提升

Conclusion: 通过维持对关键物体的持续注意力可以显著提升大视觉语言模型的视觉理解能力，CLVS方法为此提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个基于多模态场景图指导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习融合方法主要依赖纹理、对比度等低层视觉线索，难以捕捉图像中的高层语义信息。现有的文本语义引导方法使用非结构化描述，无法显式建模实体、属性和关系，也缺乏空间定位能力。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，深度耦合从文本和视觉中提取的结构化场景图，通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合等连续模块，同步优化高层语义和低层细节。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著优于最先进方法，特别是在细节保持和结构清晰度方面表现突出，在下游任务（低光目标检测、语义分割、医学图像融合）中展现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图指导的融合框架，成功解决了现有方法在语义信息捕捉方面的局限性，为红外与可见光图像融合提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中正常组织的细微变异性（如肺部解剖结构）对现有生成式异常检测方法构成重大挑战，需要开发能够处理这种变异性的新方法。

Method: 方法包括两个步骤：1）使用图像到图像翻译进行无异常重建；2）通过观察图像与生成图像对之间的补丁相似性评分来进行精确的异常定位。

Result: 在胸部CT感染性病变检测和脑MRI缺血性卒中病变分割任务中，该方法相比其他最先进的重建方法，像素级异常分割DICE分数分别提高了+1.9%和+4.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理医学影像中的正常组织变异性，在多个医学影像模态上表现出优异的异常检测和分割性能，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN是一个时间感知的Siamese跟踪框架，通过显式时间建模解决了空中目标跟踪中的尺度变化、动态背景和遮挡问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器大多关注空间线索而忽视时间依赖性，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性不足。基于相关的Siamese跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化。

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，加强时间一致性并实现更丰富的特征表示。

Result: 相比基线方法，T-SiamTPN成功率和精度分别提升13.7%和14.7%，在Jetson Nano上实现7.1 FPS的实时性能，计算效率得到保持。

Conclusion: 时间建模在Siamese跟踪框架中至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大而高效的解决方案，适合实际嵌入式应用。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出一种三阶段压缩管道，通过稀疏感知训练、结构化通道剪枝和通道知识蒸馏，显著压缩YOLOv8模型，在VisDrone数据集上实现73.51%参数减少，推理速度从26FPS提升至68FPS，仅损失少量检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上高效部署深度学习模型进行空中目标检测，需要在不影响性能的情况下实现显著压缩。

Method: 三阶段压缩管道：1) 稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2) 利用批归一化缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3) 使用可调节温度和损失加权的通道知识蒸馏来恢复精度。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减至6.85M(减少73.51%)，FLOPs从49.6G降至13.3G，推理速度从26FPS提升至45FPS，AP50仅下降2.7%。结合TensorRT后速度达68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了模型压缩与性能平衡，适合资源受限的高吞吐量场景部署，证明了在边缘设备上实时空中目标检测的可行性。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法将点云配准质量验证视为分类任务，只能将配准质量划分为少数几个类别，无法提供精细的量化评估。本文旨在通过回归方法实现更细粒度的配准质量量化。

Method: 使用回归方法进行点云配准验证，扩展了之前使用的错位相关特征，采用多尺度特征提取和基于注意力的聚合机制。

Result: 在多样化数据集上实现了准确和鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别是在具有异质空间密度的点云上表现优异。当用于指导下游建图任务时，相比最先进的基于分类的方法，显著提高了给定重配准帧数下的建图质量。

Conclusion: 基于回归的点云配准质量验证方法比分类方法能提供更精细的量化评估，在多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合的帮助下，能够准确估计配准误差并提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态对象重建的挑战，为自动驾驶系统的验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确和一致的3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

### [119] [Beyond Averages: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Gaussian Splatting and Bag of Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12938)
*Abdalla Arafa,Didier Stricker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯分布的物体级语义理解新方法，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合创建物体级嵌入表示，解决了传统方法中语义模糊的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯分布渲染技术虽然能实现实时逼真渲染，但其固有的模糊性限制了在AR/VR和机器人等领域的3D场景理解应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但alpha混合会导致跨物体语义平均，无法实现真正的3D级理解

Method: 利用预分解的物体级高斯分布，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合为每个物体创建全面的"嵌入包"表示。完全绕过可微分渲染进行语义学习，实现物体级而非高斯级的语义表示

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇物体提取的挑战，在2D开放词汇分割任务上达到与最先进方法相当的性能，同时实现了准确的开放词汇物体检索和任务自适应

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景理解提供了新的范式，通过物体级语义表示解决了传统高斯分布方法的语义模糊问题，为AR/VR和机器人应用提供了更好的3D理解能力

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Time-step Mixup知识迁移方法(TMKT)，通过时间步混合RGB和DVS输入来解决事件相机与脉冲神经网络训练中的模态分布差异问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机与脉冲神经网络结合具有能效优势，但事件数据稀缺且DVS输出稀疏性导致训练困难，现有方法忽视了RGB与DVS模态间的显著分布差异

Method: 提出细粒度时间步混合策略，利用SNN的异步特性在不同时间步插值RGB和DVS输入，并引入模态感知辅助学习目标来支持跨模态标签混合

Result: 实现了更平滑的知识迁移，缓解了训练过程中的模态偏移，在脉冲图像分类任务中取得了优异性能，多个数据集实验验证了方法有效性

Conclusion: TMKT方法通过时间步混合和模态感知学习目标有效解决了跨模态知识迁移问题，为事件相机与SNN的高效能视觉处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户点击的交互式多表面分割方法，支持多模态输入，通过特殊网络架构在RGB骨干网黑盒条件下实现高效分割


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像中多个表面同时存在且相互纠缠的复杂分割问题，传统方法难以处理这种多表面相邻的挑战性场景

Method: 设计了一种网络架构，输入包括RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击，通过多模态融合策略在图像特征提取后集成交互信息

Result: 在多模态输入下，DeLiVER数据集上平均每表面减少1.28次点击，MFNet上减少1.19次点击；RGB-only基线在传统单掩码场景中也表现优异

Conclusion: 该方法在多表面交互分割任务中有效，多模态融合策略显著提升性能，同时保持了在传统场景下的竞争力

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史手写文档的文本行分割面临独特挑战：不规则笔迹、褪色墨水、复杂布局和重叠行。标注数据稀缺使得完全监督学习方法不实用，需要开发少样本学习方法。

Method: 通过FEST竞赛形式，使用U-DIADS-TL数据集，要求参与者仅用每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，开发少样本文本行分割系统。

Result: 竞赛数据集包含多样化古代手稿，具有各种布局、退化程度和非标准格式，真实反映实际条件。

Conclusion: FEST竞赛通过强调少样本学习，旨在促进开发鲁棒且适应性强的方法，使人文研究者能以最少的手动标注工作量使用自动化文档分析工具。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER提出了一种针对SIREN网络的权重初始化方法，通过高斯噪声扰动来解决频谱瓶颈问题，在音频、图像和3D形状拟合任务中取得了显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SIREN网络在初始化不当时出现的频谱瓶颈现象，即当网络频率支持与目标频谱不匹配时，模型输出接近零且无法恢复其表示能力范围内的频率分量

Method: WINNER方法在均匀初始化的SIREN权重基础上添加高斯噪声，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，类似于随机傅里叶嵌入但无需额外可训练参数

Result: 在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，还为深度神经网络训练提供了新的自适应、目标感知初始化策略方向

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Motivation: 解决从第一人称视频数据中检测用户动作错误的问题，特别是处理细微且不频繁的错误识别挑战

Method: 双阶段重加权专家混合框架：第一阶段使用冻结ViViT和LoRA调优ViViT提取特征并通过特征级专家模块组合；第二阶段训练三个不同目标的分类器（重加权交叉熵、AUC损失、标签感知损失），并通过分类级专家模块融合预测

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务中显著优于专门的检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%，原因是新VLM学会了将合成图像与伪造相关概念对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专门的AI生成图像检测器在精心策划的基准测试上表现优异，但在真实场景中失败严重，假阴性率极高，需要更有效的检测方法

Method: 在现代视觉基础模型(VFM)上构建简单的线性分类器，通过分析文本-图像相似性来探究VLM是否学会了将合成图像与伪造相关概念对齐

Result: VFM基线方法显著超越专门检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%；发现新VLM确实学会了合成图像与伪造概念的关联，但这种能力依赖于预训练数据暴露

Conclusion: 1) 更新的VFM原始能力比静态检测器的精心设计更有效；2) 真正的泛化评估需要测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史，包括预训练阶段

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Conclusion: 小型尺寸和低功耗使其易于在争议区域或缺乏电力基础设施的地点部署

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过创新的两阶段框架和适配器设计，有效解决了单图像3D头像重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量、文本可控的3D头像生成。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架能有效联合提升VLM的感知和推理能力，为复杂视觉语言任务提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

<details>

Motivation: HR-LVLMs通过将高分辨率图像裁剪为局部图块并独立编码，虽然展现出卓越的细粒度视觉理解能力，但显著增加了视觉标记数量，导致计算和内存开销大幅增加。

Method: 基于三个关键发现：局部图块重要性差异、CLIP编码器中CLS标记的两阶段注意力模式、不同阶段强调的视觉标记编码不同粒度信息。提出内容自适应标记预算分配和功能感知标记选择策略。

Result: HERO在多样化基准测试和模型规模上实现了优越的效率-准确性权衡，所有操作都在无需训练的情况下完成。

Conclusion: 该研究为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过智能标记选择显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution

TL;DR: TFANet是一个三阶段图像-文本特征对齐网络，通过知识增强、融合和强化三个阶段解决指代图像分割中的多模态对齐问题，在复杂场景中显著提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的指代图像分割方法在多模态对齐和语言语义保持方面存在不足，特别是在包含多个视觉相似对象的复杂场景中，经常出现目标定位错误或不完整分割的问题。

Method: 提出三阶段分层框架：1)知识增强阶段(KPS)使用多尺度线性交叉注意力模块实现双向语义交换；2)知识融合阶段(KFS)通过跨模态特征扫描模块捕获长距离依赖；3)知识强化阶段(KIS)使用词级语言特征引导的语义深化模块补偿语义退化。

Result: 该方法系统性地增强了多模态对齐能力，建立了图像区域与不同粒度语言描述之间的丰富对齐关系，能够有效处理复杂场景中的长距离跨模态依赖关系。

Conclusion: TFANet通过分层三阶段设计有效解决了指代图像分割中的多模态对齐挑战，特别是在复杂场景中显著提升了分割准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLFDisc是一种U形深度增强网络，通过交叉注意力和门控机制进行频率感知增强，提出分布感知损失函数直接拟合傅里叶域信息，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用像素级损失函数，过度关注局部信息导致全局信息丢失。需要更好的方法来对齐傅里叶域信息。

Method: 提出LLFDisc U形深度增强网络，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失函数，使用闭式KL散度目标最小化傅里叶域信息差异；增强基于VGG的感知损失，在提取的深度特征中嵌入KL散度。

Result: 在多个基准测试的定性和定量评估中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和增强的感知损失，能够更鲁棒地对齐傅里叶域信息，优于传统的基于MSE的损失方法。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

Conclusion: MSDNet框架有效解决了4D雷达点云超分辨率中准确性与效率的平衡问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous

individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Conclusion: Vi-SAFE框架在公共安全监控中表现出色，有效解决了暴力检测的关键挑战，为实时监控应用提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,
and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal
framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network
(TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as
a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention
mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets,
where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of
violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE
achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming
existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its
effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出End4方法检测扩散修复图像，通过去噪重建模型和尺度感知金字塔融合模块，有效识别未见过的掩码模式并保持鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成和修复方面能力强大，但存在恶意滥用风险。现有方法难以检测基于扩散的修复图像，即使训练数据中包含类似修复图像

Method: 设计端到端去噪扩散检测方法(End4)，包括去噪重建模型改善潜在空间对齐，以及尺度感知金字塔融合模块(SPFM)在不同尺度注意力层指导下细化局部特征

Result: 建立了包含5种不同掩码区域的综合基准测试，实验表明End4能有效泛化到未见掩码模式，并在各种扰动下保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: End4方法在扩散修复图像检测方面表现出色，代码和数据集将很快发布

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出CMTSSL框架，通过多任务自监督学习训练轻量级高光谱图像分析模型，在保持高精度的同时大幅减少模型参数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像数据维度高且卫星数据传输速率慢，需要轻量高效的模型支持星上处理，减少冗余数据传输

Method: 结合掩码图像建模和解耦的空间-光谱拼图求解，采用课程学习策略逐步增加数据复杂度，联合捕获光谱连续性、空间结构和全局语义特征

Result: 在四个公开基准数据集上验证，下游分割任务表现一致提升，模型比现有最优模型轻16000倍以上

Conclusion: CMTSSL为轻量级架构的通用表示学习提供了有效解决方案，特别适合星上部署的实际高光谱应用

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due
to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research
introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise
process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data
requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from
vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by
image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour
algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process
parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The
model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,
and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解任务需要高时间分辨率处理，但计算帧级特征成本高昂，需要减少计算开销

Method: 使用ResidualViT架构，包含可学习残差连接确保时序一致性，以及token减少模块选择性丢弃冗余信息并重用预训练模型权重

Result: 在5个数据集4个任务上验证，计算成本降低60%，推理速度提升2.5倍，精度接近原始基础模型

Conclusion: ResidualViT能有效处理时序密集视频任务，大幅降低计算成本的同时保持性能

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

TL;DR: RadGame是一个AI驱动的游戏化放射学教育平台，通过定位异常和生成报告两个核心游戏模块，结合大规模公共数据集和AI自动反馈，显著提升放射学培训效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学培训主要依赖被动案例学习或需要放射科医生实时指导，缺乏即时、可扩展的反馈机制。RadGame旨在通过AI驱动的游戏化平台填补这一空白，为学习者提供结构化的自动反馈。

Method: 平台包含两个核心模块：RadGame Localize（玩家绘制异常边界框，与放射科医生标注对比，视觉语言模型生成错漏解释）和RadGame Report（玩家撰写报告，AI基于放射学报告生成指标提供结构化反馈，包括错误和遗漏提示）。

Result: 前瞻性评估显示，使用RadGame的参与者在定位准确率上提升68%（传统方法仅17%），在报告写作准确率上提升31%（传统方法仅4%）。

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训方面的潜力，重新构想了医疗AI资源在教育中的应用方式。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated

use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精确的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention模块，通过跨3D注意力机制实现内容和风格图像的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来分离风格和内容特征。

Result: 实验表明StyleSculptor在生成高质量3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的风格控制。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了零样本的风格引导3D生成，提供了细粒度的风格控制能力，为3D内容创作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Motivation: 为了解决2D图像和3D数据之间的表示鸿沟，以及减少多帧标注的需求，开发一个能够统一2D和3D表示空间的模型。

Method: 通过用3D位置嵌入丰富2D视觉特征，使3D模型能够利用强大的2D先验知识进行跨帧空间推理，支持边界框、分割掩码或直接3D标注。

Conclusion: SR-3D有效统一了2D和3D表示空间，在场景理解方面表现出色，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.
