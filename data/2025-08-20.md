### [1] [Fair Play in the Newsroom: Actor-Based Filtering Gender Discrimination in Text Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13169)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展的参与者级别管道，用于检测和缓解大规模文本语料库中的性别歧视，通过新的指标捕捉情感、句法能动性和引用风格的不对称性，并在德国报纸语料库上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出往往反映训练数据中的结构性性别不平衡问题，需要开发更有效的检测和缓解方法来构建更公平的语料库。

Method: 基于先前的话语感知公平性分析工作，引入了新的参与者级别指标来捕捉情感、句法能动性和引用风格的不对称性，支持诊断性语料分析和基于排除的平衡方法。

Result: 在1980-2024年德国报纸文章语料库上的应用显示，该方法在多个语言维度上显著改善了性别平衡，但更微妙的情感偏见和框架偏见仍然存在。

Conclusion: 虽然表面层面的不对称可以通过过滤和重新平衡来缓解，但更微妙的偏见形式仍然存在，需要进一步研究话语基础的公平性审计和公平语料库构建。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

### [2] [MM-BrowseComp: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13186)
*Shilong Li,Xingyuan Bu,Wenjie Wang,Jiaheng Liu,Jun Dong,Haoyang He,Hao Lu,Haozhe Zhang,Chenchen Jing,Zhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Jiayi Tian,Chenchen Zhang,Tianhao Peng,Yancheng He,Jihao Gu,Yuanxing Zhang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Wangchunshu Zhou,Zhaoxiang Zhang,Ruizhe Ding,Shilei Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MM-BrowseComp是一个新的多模态网页浏览基准测试，包含224个手工制作的问题，专门评估AI代理的多模态检索和推理能力，现有最佳模型仅达到29.02%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页浏览基准测试如BrowseComp主要关注文本信息，忽视了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 创建包含224个挑战性问题的基准测试，这些问题在提示中包含图像，网页搜索和推理过程中的关键信息可能嵌入在图像或视频中，并提供验证清单进行细粒度分析。

Result: 对最先进模型的评估显示，即使是OpenAI o3等顶级模型也仅达到29.02%的准确率，表明当前模型的多模态能力和原生多模态推理存在不足。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在多模态网页浏览任务中表现不佳，需要开发更好的多模态推理能力来处理网页中的图像和视频内容。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

### [3] [Overcoming Latency Bottlenecks in On-Device Speech Translation: A Cascaded Approach with Alignment-Based Streaming MT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13358)
*Zeeshan Ahmed,Frank Seide,Niko Moritz,Ju Lin,Ruiming Xie,Simone Merello,Zhe Liu,Christian Fuegen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时流式语音翻译方法，有效平衡翻译质量和延迟，通过ASR和MT的高效集成，在设备端实现低延迟高质量的对话翻译


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时设备端流式语音翻译中ASR和MT集成面临的挑战，特别是如何在保持实时性的同时提高翻译质量

Method: 使用RNN-T进行实时语音识别，利用ASR生成的语言学线索管理上下文，采用超时和强制完成等高效束搜索剪枝技术控制实时因子

Result: 在设备端双语对话语音翻译中，该方法在延迟和质量方面均优于基线系统，显著缩小了与离线翻译系统的质量差距

Conclusion: 该技术为更准确高效的实时语音翻译铺平了道路，实现了实时流式翻译质量的重要突破

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

### [4] [Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13365)
*Dylan Phelps,Rodrigo Wilkens,Edward Gow-Smith,Thomas Pickard,Maggie Mi,Aline Villavicencio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型的推理能力对习语检测性能的影响，发现推理效果比预期小且变化较大，大模型能较好理解习语含义，而小模型需要额外提供定义才能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型的发展，大型语言模型在需要逻辑步骤的任务上表现提升。习语检测作为语言任务，需要先理解表达再进行推理判断，因此研究推理能力对习语检测的影响具有重要意义。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列（1.5B到70B参数）在四个习语检测数据集上进行评估，分析思维链推理的效果，并对小模型提供定义提示进行实验。

Result: 推理效果比预期小且变化较大：小模型通过思维链推理能从数学调优中间模型提升性能，但达不到基础模型水平；大模型（14B、32B、70B）有适度提升。大模型能准确理解习语含义，小模型常无法输出实际含义。

Conclusion: 模型大小对习语理解能力有显著影响，大模型具备更好的习语理解能力，而小模型需要外部知识（如定义提示）来弥补理解不足，从而提升习语检测性能。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

### [5] [Whispering Context: Distilling Syntax and Semantics for Long Speech Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13376)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖方法，通过从LLaMA模型中提取上下文知识到Whisper来增强ASR系统，在长音频转录中显著改善词错误率、命名实体识别、大小写和标点符号准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转录中经常难以保持句法和语义准确性，影响命名实体识别、大小写和标点等任务

Method: 使用两种策略：(1) 通过最优传输进行token级蒸馏以对齐维度和序列长度，(2) 最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入之间的表示损失，融合语法和语义

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上的评估显示，在词错误率、命名实体识别、大小写和标点方面取得显著改进

Conclusion: 通过引入新颖的NER指标和探索语义感知ASR，这项工作突显了将语言上下文整合到转录中的价值，为长语音中稳健、上下文感知的ASR奠定了基础

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

### [6] [Datarus-R1: An Adaptive Multi-Step Reasoning LLM for Automated Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13382)
*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B是一个14B参数的开源语言模型，专门针对数据分析和研究生级别问题解决进行微调，采用双奖励框架和GRPO优化训练，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统LLM在复杂问题解决中存在的格式崩溃、冗长循环和推理不连贯等问题，开发一个能够执行完整分析轨迹的虚拟数据分析师模型。

Method: 使用轨迹中心合成数据生成器创建14.4万个标记笔记本片段，采用双奖励框架（结构信号+分层奖励模型），结合GRPO优化训练，支持ReAct工具调用和CoT推理两种模式。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench等基准测试中准确率提升30%，同时减少18-49%的token使用量，达到甚至超越更大模型如QwQ-32B的性能水平。

Conclusion: Datarus通过轨迹式训练和双模式推理接口，有效解决了LLM在复杂问题解决中的常见问题，展现了高效、准确的分析能力，为专业级AI助手提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

### [7] [ALIGN: Word Association Learning for Cross-Cultural Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13426)
*Chunhua Liu,Kabir Manandhar Shrestha,Sukai Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于母语者自由词汇联想规范的参数高效微调方法，通过SFT和PPO优化来提升LLM的文化对齐能力，在英语和中文上都取得了显著效果提升，7-8B模型性能媲美70B基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在跨文化沟通中仍存在训练语料分布偏差问题，缺乏有效的文化建模和对齐方法，需要探索基于人类认知的文化对齐解决方案。

Method: 使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和中文词汇联想数据，通过监督微调(SFT)和PPO偏好优化对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行参数高效微调。

Result: SFT使英语P@5提升16-20%，中文提升43-165%，具体性中位数提升+0.20，达到人类水平的效价和唤醒度。在世界价值观调查中，微调模型向目标文化偏移，Qwen的中文对齐响应翻倍，Llama的美国偏见下降三分之一。

Conclusion: 研究表明几百万个基于文化的联想数据可以在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下实现价值对齐，7-8B模型性能媲美70B基线，强调了基于人类认知的研究在改善AI模型文化对齐方面的重要性和前景。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

### [8] [ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514)
*Hongxin Ding,Baixiang Huang,Yue Fang,Weibin Liao,Xinke Jiang,Zheng Li,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMed是一个强化学习框架，通过Shapley信息增益奖励机制，将医疗大语言模型从被动回答转变为主动提问范式，显著提升了医疗诊断的准确性和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动信息收集能力，这在需要交互式问诊的真实临床场景中存在误诊风险。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的ProMed框架，使用Shapley信息增益(SIG)奖励量化问题临床价值，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量交互轨迹，并通过SIG引导的奖励分配机制进行策略优化。

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均超越现有最佳方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ProMed成功实现了医疗LLM从被动到主动范式的转变，通过强化学习和信息价值量化显著提升了医疗问诊的交互质量和诊断准确性。

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

### [9] [Saudi-Dialect-ALLaM: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Dialectal Arabic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13525)
*Hassan Barmandah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用LoRA微调沙特阿拉伯首个基础模型ALLaM-7B，通过方言标记训练方法显著提升沙特阿拉伯方言生成能力，在方言控制、文本保真度和多样性方面优于多个通用指令模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语大语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，对沙特方言(如Najdi和Hijazi)支持有限，这限制了模型捕捉真实方言变化的能力。

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集(5,466对合成指令-响应对)，通过LoRA微调ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview模型，比较两种变体：带方言标记训练和不带标记训练。

Result: 方言标记模型表现最佳，将沙特方言率从47.97%提升至84.21%，MSA泄漏从32.63%降至6.21%，保真度指标也有提升(chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059)。

Conclusion: LoRA微调方法在沙特方言生成任务上优于多个强基线模型，实现了更好的方言控制和文本质量，同时避免了元数据标签回显问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

### [10] [MATA (māta): Mindful Assessment of the Telugu Abilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13526)
*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATA是一个用于评估大型语言模型在泰卢固语能力的评估数据集，包含729个多项选择题和开放式问题，涵盖多种语言维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对低资源语言如泰卢固语的LLM评估基准，需要细粒度分析来理解模型局限性并指导开发更具语言能力的模型。

Method: 构建包含729个问题的评估数据集，评估11个开源和闭源LLM，分析模型在多项选择题中依赖表面启发式策略的情况，比较LLM作为评判者与人工评估的可靠性。

Result: 发现LLM在多项选择题中依赖答案位置和干扰项模式等表面启发式方法，在低资源语言中LLM作为评判者的可靠性需要进一步验证。

Conclusion: 细粒度评估对于理解模型局限性至关重要，可以为开发更具语言能力的LLM提供信息，同时为泰卢固语NLP的未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

### [11] [Compressed Models are NOT Trust-equivalent to Their Large Counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13533)
*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 压缩模型即使准确率接近原始大模型，但在可解释性和校准性方面存在显著差异，不能作为可信赖的等价替代


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注压缩对准确率的影响，但性能等同并不保证可信度等同，需要评估压缩模型是否与原始大模型具有相同的可信度

Method: 提出二维可信度评估框架：1）可解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试）2）校准相似性（使用ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图）

Result: 实验发现压缩模型与原始BERT-base模型在可解释性对齐度低，校准相似性存在显著不匹配，即使准确率几乎相同

Conclusion: 压缩模型不能作为大模型的直接可信替代品，部署时需要超越性能等同的仔细评估

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

### [12] [A Comparative Study of Decoding Strategies in Medical Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13580)
*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同解码策略对医疗领域大语言模型性能的影响，发现确定性策略（如beam search）优于随机策略，医疗专用模型在部分任务中表现更好但对解码策略更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域，文本生成的准确性至关重要，但解码策略对输出质量的影响尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在探索不同解码策略在医疗任务中的表现差异。

Method: 在五个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话和图像描述）中评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专用和通用大语言模型，比较不同模型大小和评估指标。

Result: 确定性策略（beam search）表现最佳，随机策略（η和top-k采样）最差。较大模型整体得分更高但推理时间更长。医疗专用模型在两个任务中优于通用模型，但对解码策略更敏感。不同评估指标间相关性因任务而异。

Conclusion: 解码策略的选择在医疗应用中至关重要，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择本身，需要根据具体任务谨慎选择解码方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

### [13] [Who Gets the Mic? Investigating Gender Bias in the Speaker Assignment of a Speech-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13603)
*Dariia Puhach,Amir H. Payberah,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了语音大语言模型（Speech-LLMs）中的性别偏见问题，通过分析Bark TTS模型的说话人分配来检测是否存在系统性性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然语音大语言模型展现出与文本LLM相似的涌现能力和上下文意识，但其在性别偏见方面的表现尚不明确。与文本模型隐含编码性别关联不同，语音模型必须产生具有性别特征的声音，使得说话人选择成为显性的偏见线索。

Method: 提出利用说话人分配作为偏见分析工具的方法论。构建两个数据集：（1）包含性别刻板印象职业的Professions数据集；（2）具有性别内涵词的Gender-Colored Words数据集。评估Bark TTS模型对文本提示的默认说话人分配模式。

Result: Bark模型没有表现出系统性偏见，但显示出性别意识并存在一定的性别倾向性。

Conclusion: 语音大语言模型虽然不像文本模型那样存在系统性性别偏见，但仍具有性别感知能力，需要在模型设计和训练数据方面持续关注偏见问题。

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaDocVQA是一个针对低资源环境下长文档视觉问答的自适应框架，通过混合文本检索、智能数据增强和自适应集成推理三大创新，在日语文档VQA基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文档视觉问答在低资源环境下面临的上下文限制和训练数据不足的挑战，特别是针对日语等低资源语言的文档处理需求。

Method: 提出三核心创新：1)混合文本检索架构实现有效文档分割；2)智能数据增强管道自动生成高质量推理问答对并进行多级验证；3)自适应集成推理机制包含动态配置生成和早停机制。

Result: 在JDocQA数据集上取得显著成果：是非问题83.04%、事实问题52.66%、数值问题44.12%的准确率，在LAVA数据集上达到59%准确率，建立了日语文档VQA的新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源语言和专门领域提供了可扩展的基础，每个组件都通过消融研究确认了其有效贡献，代码已开源。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and
specialized domains. Our code available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现大语言模型中的持久性概念遗忘，能够在移除有害知识的同时保持模型的其他能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除不需要的知识同时保持模型效用。现有稀疏自编码器方法主要在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP自动识别跨多个层的显著SAE特征并抑制其激活，采用参数高效的方式实现持久性概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个LLM上的实验表明，该方法在WMDP基准的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示CRISP实现了目标和良性概念的语义连贯分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级概念遗忘方法，能够精确抑制目标特征，为模型安全部署提供了重要技术手段。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViExam基准测试，评估视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育内容上的表现，发现现有模型在跨语言推理方面表现不佳，多数模型低于人类平均水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型主要在英语多模态任务上表现优异，但在低资源语言（如越南语）的真实多模态教育内容上的能力尚未得到充分探索，需要评估模型在跨语言多模态推理方面的实际表现。

Method: 构建ViExam基准测试，包含2,548个多模态越南语考试问题，涵盖7个学术领域。测试多种最先进的视觉语言模型，包括闭源和开源模型，并尝试跨语言提示和人类协作等策略。

Result: 最先进VLMs平均准确率57.74%，开源模型27.70%，大多数模型低于人类平均水平（66.54%）。只有o3模型（74.07%）超过人类平均，但仍远低于人类最佳表现（99.60%）。跨语言提示反而降低性能，人类协作可提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育内容上表现有限，跨语言能力不足，需要针对低资源语言开发更有效的多模态模型，人类协作是提升性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

<details>

Motivation: 研究大语言模型处理包含通用概括（如'鸟会飞'）的可废止推理能力，这对非单调逻辑、认知科学和概念获取很重要

Method: 测试28个LLM在20种可废止推理模式上的表现，比较零样本、少样本和思维链提示的效果

Result: 前沿模型处理默认推理问题较好，但性能差异显著；少样本提示略有改善，思维链提示导致平均准确率下降11.14%；多数模型难以区分可废止推理和演绎推理

Conclusion: 当前LLM在默认推理方面既有潜力也存在明显局限，需要改进对通用陈述的理解和推理能力

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了词嵌入解释方法的有效性，证明仅凭预测准确度不能可靠反映词嵌入中真实语义知识的编码，因为即使随机信息也能被成功预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型中隐含编码的知识对于提高AI系统可解释性至关重要，但现有方法基于预测语义特征准确度来判断词嵌入知识含量的假设存在问题。

Method: 通过实验证明现有解释方法能够成功预测随机信息，分析预测性能主要受算法上限而非真实语义表示决定，比较不同数据集上的预测表现。

Result: 发现预测准确度不能可靠指示词嵌入中真实特征的可解释性，结果主要由向量空间内的几何相似性而非语义属性的真实涌现决定。

Conclusion: 仅基于预测性能的数据集比较不能可靠表明哪个数据集更好地被词嵌入捕获，需要重新评估词嵌入知识解释方法的有效性。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Motivation: 随着EEG在神经科学和临床实践中的广泛应用，如何高效检索和语义解释大规模、多源、异构的EEG数据成为一个紧迫挑战

Method: 提出三层超图框架，将EEG领域知识、个体病例和大规模存储库统一为可遍历的n元关系超图，实现联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成

Conclusion: 该框架在现实世界临床决策支持方面具有强大潜力，同时发布了首个跨疾病、跨角色的EEG临床QA基准数据集

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs在科学问答中的谄媚行为，提出了评估框架和Pressure-Tune方法来增强模型的事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要事实严谨性的领域中经常表现出谄媚行为，即倾向于迎合用户信念而忽视正确性。这种行为在高风险的科学问答环境中尤其危险，但相关研究仍然不足。

Method: 提出了统一的评估框架来量化谄媚语境对模型行为的影响，包括对抗性提示设置和针对性指标。开发了Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗对话上进行微调，结合思维链推理来拒绝用户错误信息。

Result: 系统评估显示开源和专有模型普遍存在谄媚倾向，主要由对齐策略而非模型规模驱动。Pressure-Tune显著增强了模型的谄媚抵抗能力，同时不损害准确性或对有效反馈的响应性。

Conclusion: Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的方法来实现更真实和原则性的模型行为，为解决LLMs的谄媚问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

TL;DR: MGT-Prism：一种基于频域分析的机器生成文本检测方法，通过低频滤波和动态频谱对齐策略提升跨领域泛化能力，在11个测试数据集上平均准确率提升0.90%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在同领域表现良好但跨领域泛化能力差，存在领域偏移问题，需要开发更好的跨领域检测方法

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现机器生成文本与人类撰写文本在频域存在显著差异。设计了低频域滤波模块过滤领域敏感特征，以及动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和领域不变特征

Result: 在三个领域泛化场景的11个测试数据集上，平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，优于现有最佳基线方法

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了有效视角，MGT-Prism方法通过频域特征处理显著提升了跨领域检测性能

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成儿童语言的能力，发现LLM生成的文本与真实儿童语言在词汇丰富度、词频分布、词性和语义层面存在显著差异，few-shot提示仅能略微改善相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育中的应用日益增多，需要了解它们是否能真实模拟儿童语言特征，这对于教育工具的开发至关重要。

Method: 使用德国儿童图片故事描述语料库，通过零样本和few-shot提示生成LLM文本，从心理语言学角度比较词汇频率、词汇丰富度、句子长度、词性标注和语义相似性等特征。

Result: LLM生成的文本更长但词汇丰富度更低，更多依赖高频词，名词使用不足。语义空间分析显示相似度低，few-shot提示仅能略微提高相似性。

Conclusion: LLMs难以准确复制儿童语言模式，这对儿童教育工具中使用LLM生成内容的适宜性提出了重要问题。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成医学摘要时的事实准确性担忧，通过提供句子级引用来追溯证据来源，让用户能够评估摘要的准确性。

Method: 创建TracSum基准数据集，标注7个关键医学方面；提出四指标评估框架；开发Track-Then-Sum摘要流水线（先追踪句子再摘要）。

Result: TracSum能有效评估可追溯的基于方面摘要任务；显式执行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性；包含完整上下文能进一步提升完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum是一个有效的基准，显式追踪和完整上下文对提高医学摘要的准确性和完整性都很重要。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何理解道德维度，与人类进行比较，填补了之前使用确定性标注方法忽略人类分歧不确定性的研究空白

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架建模标注者分歧，捕捉偶然性不确定性和认知不确定性，评估了Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick等顶级模型，处理了100万+模型查询

Result: AI模型通常能排在前25%的人类标注者水平，平衡准确率远高于平均水平，产生的假阴性远少于人类，显示出更强的道德检测敏感性

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在道德理解方面表现优异，不仅达到人类高水平，在某些方面甚至超越人类，特别是在减少假阴性方面表现出更强的道德敏感性

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在控制文本长度方面存在挑战，经常超出或达不到显式长度指令，因为无法可靠地保持内部token计数

Method: 在提示中添加倒计时标记和显式计数规则，使模型在生成时进行计数，实现"边写边数"的策略

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI上，GPT-4.1的严格长度符合率从低于30%提升到95%以上，超过了流行的草稿-修订基线方法，同时保持了答案质量

Conclusion: 仅通过提示工程就能实现精确的长度控制，为训练或解码方法提供了轻量级替代方案

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Motivation: 自然语言生成评估是AI应用的关键挑战，虽然人工评估是黄金标准但成本高昂且难以扩展，自动评估指标的发展虽然多样但缺乏统一标准，需要系统分析现有方法的有效性。

Method: 通过对现有自动评估指标的全面审查，包括方法论分析、文档化优缺点、验证方法以及与人工评估的相关性研究，特别关注了最新的LLM-as-a-Judge方法和RAG任务评估。

Result: 发现所有评估指标都只能捕捉文本质量的特定方面，效果因任务和数据集而异，验证实践缺乏结构化，与人工评估的相关性不一致，这些挑战在最新的LLM评估方法中同样存在。

Conclusion: 挑战了寻找'完美指标'的追求，建议根据具体任务需求选择指标，采用互补评估策略，并强调新指标开发应注重改进验证方法论。

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

### [28] [MME-SCI: A Comprehensive and Challenging Science Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13938)
*Jiacheng Ruan,Dan Jiang,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MME-SCI多模态科学评测基准，解决现有基准在跨语言推理、多模态覆盖和细粒度知识标注方面的不足，包含1019个高质量问题，覆盖4个学科5种语言，实验显示现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域多模态大语言模型评测基准存在三个关键问题：多语言场景推理能力评估不足、多模态覆盖不充分、科学知识点缺乏细粒度标注，需要构建更全面的评测基准。

Method: 收集1019个高质量问答对，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物4个学科，支持中英法西日5种语言，包含3种评测模式，对16个开源模型和4个闭源模型进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果表明MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有广泛挑战性，如图像模式下o4-mini在数理化生准确率仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%、29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，通过多语言和细粒度知识属性深入分析模型性能，识别了特定领域的弱点，为多模态科学推理能力评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

TL;DR: 提出ReviewGraph框架，将酒店评论转换为知识图谱，结合情感分析和图嵌入技术来预测评论评分，性能媲美大型语言模型但计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 酒店行业需要理解影响客户评分的因素来提升客户满意度和业务表现，传统NLP方法在可解释性和计算成本方面存在局限。

Method: 从文本评论中提取(主语,谓语,宾语)三元组构建知识图谱，使用Node2Vec图嵌入和情感特征，通过机器学习分类器预测评分。

Result: 在HotelRec数据集上，ReviewGraph性能与最佳模型相当但计算成本更低，在Cohen's Kappa等一致性指标上优于基线方法。

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We
will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page

Motivation: 现有的使用合成数据微调LLM的方法受到数据多样性低和事实不一致性的限制，需要更好的方法来提升长上下文建模能力。

Method: 将上下文片段视为老虎机的臂，基于预期奖励分数选择片段输入LLM生成响应，迭代更新分数，最后使用DPO方法优化模型。

Conclusion: LongMab-PO框架通过智能的片段选择和DPO训练，有效解决了长上下文建模中的数据质量问题，为LLM的长文本处理能力提供了新的优化途径。

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SvS策略，通过自我对弈和变分问题合成来维持RLVR训练中的策略熵，显著提升Pass@k性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练虽然提高Pass@1性能，但会导致策略熵下降，减少生成多样性，限制Pass@k性能的上限

Method: 在线自我对弈与变分问题合成(SvS)，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题，保持参考答案不变

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在3B到32B不同模型规模的12个推理基准上表现一致

Conclusion: SvS策略能有效维持训练过程中的策略熵，显著改善Pass@k性能，具有很好的泛化性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在微调为智能体时会出现安全对齐失效问题，提出PING方法通过在响应前添加自然语言前缀来拒绝有害请求，同时保持良性任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在微调为智能体系统时，安全对齐经常被忽视，导致模型更容易执行有害任务且拒绝倾向降低，需要解决这一安全挑战。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法，通过迭代生成和选择自然语言前缀，在保持任务性能的同时优化拒绝有害请求的行为。

Result: 实验表明PING显著提升了微调LLM智能体的安全性，在网页导航和代码生成任务中均优于现有提示方法，且不影响有效性。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单有效的安全增强方法，前缀标记对行为修改至关重要，线性探针分析揭示了性能提升的内在机制。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字健康分析面临关键挑战：患者生成的健康内容包含复杂情感和医疗背景，需要稀缺的领域专业知识，而传统ML方法受限于医疗环境中的数据短缺和隐私限制。在线健康社区中的混合情感帖子、临床术语和隐含情感表达需要专业知识进行准确情感分析。

Method: 开发结构化编码本系统编码专家解读指南，通过上下文学习让LLMs应用领域知识。比较6个GPT模型、DeepSeek和LLaMA 3.1与预训练语言模型（BioBERT变体）和基于词典的方法，使用来自两个OHC的400个专家标注帖子进行验证。

Result: LLMs实现卓越性能，同时展示专家级一致性。高度一致性（与专家间一致性水平无统计学显著差异）表明超越了表面模式识别的知识整合。不同LLM模型的一致性能，加上上下文学习的支持，为数字健康分析提供了有前景的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了数字健康研究中专家知识短缺的关键挑战，为患者监测、干预评估和循证健康策略实现了实时、专家质量的分析。

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出YOLO11-CR模型，用于实时驾驶员疲劳检测，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生理和车辆动力学方法侵入性强且硬件依赖，视觉方法在检测小目标、遮挡物体和多尺度特征建模方面存在挑战，需要开发轻量高效的实时检测方案。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含卷积与注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，以及矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息改善空间定位。

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精确率、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型，消融实验验证了模块有效性。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监测提供了实用高性能解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时间建模、多模态数据集成和嵌入式优化。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Conclusion: Mirage-R1通过创新的推理机制和训练策略，有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测的挑战，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和调用专家模型工具来解决大视觉语言模型在OCR任务中的幻觉问题，显著提升了文档图像解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在OCR任务中存在幻觉问题（生成图像中不存在的文本），且相比专门训练的专家模型效果较差。需要一种方法来结合两者的优势，既保持通用性又提升准确性。

Method: 提出推理与工具交织的训练框架：模型先自行识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并反思推理过程来提供最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench基准测试中，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理版本和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了LVLMs在OCR任务中的幻觉问题，通过结合专家模型的准确性和LVLMs的通用性，以较低成本实现了性能提升，为文档图像解析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Conclusion: 基于CNN的组件分类方法能有效解决乌尔都语字符识别问题，避免了传统分割方法的高错误率问题

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

Conclusion: 难度感知的训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的有序分类问题，具有临床应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个即插即用的视觉token剪枝框架，用于自动驾驶中的多视角视觉语言模型，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，显著减少计算开销同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的视觉语言模型处理高分辨率多视角图像时产生大量视觉token，导致二次复杂度的自注意力机制带来巨大计算开销和延迟，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，基于各摄像头对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试中，仅保留10%视觉token时，预填充阶段实现6.4倍加速，FLOPs消耗降至13.4%，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，在显著提升效率和减少内存消耗的同时维持或改善任务性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本，在攻击成功率和视觉质量方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚如何利用Lp约束攻击的见解来提高感知效果，需要开发既能保持攻击有效性又具有良好感知质量的对抗样本生成方法。

Method: DAASH采用多阶段方式运行：在每个阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真，动态调节每个基础攻击在不同阶段的贡献。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上的对抗训练模型评估显示，DAASH显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，在SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标上分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基准方法。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部整形手术效果评估缺乏客观、可量化的标准，需要开发一个可扩展且可解释的计算机视觉框架来提供数据驱动的美学结果评估，帮助手术规划、患者咨询和客观结果评估。

Method: 利用自动化地标检测、几何面部对称性计算、基于深度学习的年龄估计和鼻部形态分析构建分析流程，基于7,160张术前术后面部照片的大规模数据集进行验证。

Result: 在鼻整形亚组中，96.2%的患者至少在一个鼻部测量指标上显示改善；在更广泛的面部正面视图队列中，71.3%的患者在整体面部对称性或感知年龄方面有显著改善；患者身份一致性验证达到99.5%以上的真匹配率。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可重复的量化基准和新颖数据集，能够促进数据驱动的手术规划、患者咨询和跨实践的客观结果评估，为面部整形手术的美学效果评估提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准中存在Easy-Options Bias问题，VLMs仅凭视觉和选项就能猜对答案，无需问题。提出了GroundAttack工具生成困难负选项，创建无偏数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有VQA基准存在严重偏差，模型可以通过视觉-选项相似度匹配轻松猜对答案，无法真实评估模型的问答能力。

Method: 提出GroundAttack工具包，自动生成与正确答案视觉相似度相当的困难负选项，创建EOB-free标注数据集。

Result: 在无偏数据集上，当前VLMs在(V+O)设置下准确率接近随机，在(V+Q+O)设置下准确率大幅下降，证明原基准存在严重偏差。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的系统性偏差问题，提供了更真实的评估基准，有助于推动VLMs真正理解能力的提升。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Conclusion: 有效的知识蒸馏和结构化多智能体监督能够使轻量级VLMs具备复杂推理能力，VISTA的紧凑架构便于边缘设备部署，实现实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了面部特征解耦的挑战，为可控说话头生成提供了有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Motivation: 肾结石分类对个性化治疗和复发预防至关重要，但传统CNN模型在捕捉长距离依赖关系方面存在局限，影响在多变成像条件下的性能

Method: 使用在ImageNet-21k上预训练的ViT-base模型与ResNet50基线模型进行对比分析，在两个离体数据集（CCD相机和软性输尿管镜图像）上进行评估

Result: ViT模型在所有成像条件下均优于ResNet50，在最复杂的子集（内窥镜图像切片）中达到95.2%准确率和95.1% F1分数（ResNet50为64.5%和59.3%），在混合视图子集中达到87.1%准确率（ResNet50为78.4%）

Conclusion: ViT架构在肾结石图像分析中提供更优越的分类性能，是可扩展的传统CNN替代方案

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

TL;DR: MINR提出了一种共享中间层的隐式神经表示方法，通过参数共享大幅减少多图像编码的计算和存储开销，在保持性能的同时节省60%参数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的神经网络，导致多图像编码时计算和存储效率低下

Method: 通过分析训练好的INR发现中间层权重分布高度相似，因此共享中间层而保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征

Conclusion: MINR通过层共享策略显著提高了多图像编码效率，证明了隐式神经表示中参数共享的可行性和有效性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ提出了一种分布感知的Hadamard量化方案，针对隐式神经表示(INRs)中的权重和激活值进行量化，通过Hadamard变换将不同分布统一为标准钟形分布，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。INRs中不同层的权重和激活值分布差异显著，需要统一的量化方案来充分利用量化带来的硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1）分析发现INRs中首尾层权重分布与中间层不同，最后一层激活值与前面层显著不同；2）使用Hadamard变换将这些不同分布统一为标准钟形分布；3）应用标准量化器进行量化；4）在FPGA上实现硬件高效方案。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上，DHQ相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高降低98.3%，优于之前的量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的Hadamard量化方案，成功解决了INRs中权重和激活值的分布差异问题，实现了显著的硬件效率提升，为INRs的实际部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Result: 在多模态重建任务上的大量实验表明，在噪声条件下，该方法相比原始INRs在峰值信噪比(PSNR)上实现了高达7.5dB的改进。

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒损失函数有效增强了INRs对权重扰动的鲁棒性，为解决INRs在实际应用中的脆弱性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过多任务学习和分层注意力机制有效提升了微表情识别性能，证明了融合2D/3D CNN和多任务学习的有效性

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Motivation: 多视图聚类虽然能通过利用视图间的一致性和互补性提升性能，但面向聚类的表示学习往往被忽视，需要进一步探索有效表示来增强特征空间的可区分性

Method: 包含三个模块：1）多视图实例学习模块通过重构自编码器和对比学习对齐一致信息并保留私有特征；2）特征和簇的双层解耦增强特征空间和簇空间的区分度；3）一致性学习模块将样本的不同视图及其邻居视为正对，学习聚类分配的一致性并压缩簇内空间

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有优越性

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过创新的双层解耦和一致性学习机制，有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，为多视图数据分析提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Motivation: 现有HDR成像技术忽视了快门速度和ISO之间的复杂交互关系，以及在动态场景中运动模糊的影响，导致重建质量受限

Method: 提出强化学习方法AdaptiveAE，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图，基于用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应选择最优ISO和快门速度序列

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能水平，相比传统解决方案能够找到更好的曝光调度方案

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE通过强化学习优化曝光参数选择，有效解决了动态场景中HDR成像的质量问题，为高动态范围成像提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 羽毛球双打比赛在国际赛事中比单打更普遍，但由于数据可用性和多人跟踪的挑战，先前研究主要集中在单打分析上，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用ViT-Pose从ShuttleSet单打数据集中提取关键点，通过基于ST-GCN的对比学习框架进行嵌入，采用自定义多目标跟踪算法解决ID切换问题，最后使用Transformer分类器进行击球识别。

Result: 研究证明了将基于姿态的击球识别扩展到双打羽毛球的可行性，为双打特定数据集奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作扩展了羽毛球分析能力，为理解这种主要但研究不足的比赛形式建立了基础，推动了双打羽毛球分析的发展。

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化标记器（如VQ-GAN）主要关注纹理和颜色特征，忽略了几何结构信息，导致结构化视觉信息建模能力不足。

Method: 提出视觉高斯量化（VGQ）框架，将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数，通过增加高斯密度来平衡标记效率和视觉丰富度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准上，VGQ获得rFID 1.00的强重建质量，通过增加高斯密度进一步提升到rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过整合2D高斯分布有效解决了传统量化方法的局限性，为图像生成提供了更丰富的结构感知标记表示。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Conclusion: 基础模型特征分布的几何知识具有重要价值，通过分布校准可以有效弥合训练样本与真实分布之间的差距

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion

nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a

This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Conclusion: EAvatar框架在头重建任务中实现了更好的表达感知和变形感知能力，显著提升了重建质量

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Conclusion: FLAIR通过引入频率选择和空间定位机制，有效解决了隐式神经表示的频谱偏差问题，在多个视觉任务中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码虽然性能优越，但模型参数大、计算成本高，阻碍了实际部署，特别是在移动边缘设备等资源受限环境中

Method: 双模式优化：架构上使用更瘦高效的层替代传统3x3卷积；操作上采用两阶段自适应通道剪枝策略（训练时软剪枝识别冗余通道，训练后硬剪枝永久移除）

Result: 相比基线减少90.4%参数和88.9%计算量，在感知质量指标上优于最新视频编码标准VVC

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现高效的GFVC部署，特别适用于资源受限环境

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Result: 实验结果显示该方法有效增加了脉冲信号的信息含量，提升了SNN性能，同时遵循神经形态计算原则

Conclusion: 这种生物启发的方法具有强大发展潜力，有助于克服神经形态计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力依赖于已知异常样本的先验知识，需要一种无需重新训练就能检测未见类别异常的方法

Method: 包含三个核心组件：字典构建（用正常参考图像特征模拟字典）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询特征，无法检索的视为异常）、查询判别正则化（通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力）

Result: 在7个工业和医学数据集上的大量实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Method: 提出时序采样策略构建训练数据，采用人体中心归一化和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify成为实用简单的基线方法，在保持精度的同时大幅提升效率，具有良好的泛化能力和灵活性

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了特征语义，为高性能IoT应用提供了鲁棒且可扩展的智能视频分析解决方案

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Motivation: 现有RVOS方法过度关注特征提取和时序建模，相对忽视了分割头的设计。实际上分割头设计仍有很大改进空间，特别是在边界分割能力方面。

Method: 1. 集成现有分割方法增强边界分割能力；2. 利用文本到视频扩散模型进行特征提取；3. 移除传统噪声预测模块以避免随机性影响精度；4. 设计时序上下文掩码细化(TCMR)模块克服VAE特征提取限制

Result: 在四个公开RVOS基准测试中 consistently 取得了state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 通过改进分割头设计、简化模型结构并增强特征提取能力，提出的方法显著提升了参考视频对象分割的质量和准确性

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型在识别图像旋转角度方面存在显著缺陷，特别是无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转，即使通过辅助信息或微调也难以改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理方面的能力，特别是检测图像旋转方向的能力，这对于理解模型的空间感知能力至关重要。

Method: 创建包含350张图像的RotBench基准测试集，测试多种先进MLLM模型（包括GPT-5、o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro）在不同旋转角度下的识别能力，并尝试使用辅助信息、思维链提示和微调等方法进行改进。

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别0度（正立）图像，部分能识别180度（倒立）图像，但所有模型都无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转。辅助信息和微调只能带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在空间旋转识别能力上与人类感知存在显著差距，特别是在区分90度和270度旋转方面表现出根本性缺陷。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍需提升。虽然token减少是提高模型效率的有效方法，但将其应用于SSM需要考虑其独特的序列建模能力。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1）利用状态转移参数Δ作为信息量度量来量化token重要性；2）引入战略性token排列以保持序列信息流；3）针对SSM架构特点进行定制化设计。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在效率和性能之间实现了优越的平衡，即使在激进的token减少情况下也能保持鲁棒性。在图像分类、视频和音频等多个领域都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM模型提供了一种有效的效率提升方法，在保持序列建模能力的同时显著减少计算成本，适用于多种SSM应用场景。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Conclusion: 双解耦设计能有效解决语义和几何特征的冲突问题，通过专门的优化路径和创新的融合方法显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

TL;DR: TalkVid是一个新的大规模、高质量、多样化音频驱动说话头合成数据集，包含1244小时视频和7729名独特说话人，解决了现有模型在种族、语言和年龄群体多样性方面的泛化差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要是由于现有训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集，并创建分层评估集TalkVid-Bench，包含500个在关键人口统计和语言轴上平衡的剪辑。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于在先前数据集上训练的对应模型，表现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力。TalkVid-Bench分析揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集解决了音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题，TalkVid-Bench评估集为未来研究提供了必要的基准工具，强调了考虑人口统计子组性能差异的重要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种仅使用RGB图像的类别级物体姿态估计方法，通过transformer网络预测几何特征并使用RANSAC-PnP算法计算姿态，在缺乏深度信息的场景中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RGB-D的类别级物体姿态估计方法在缺乏深度信息的场景中面临重大挑战，需要开发仅使用RGB图像的解决方案

Method: 设计基于transformer的神经网络预测和融合目标物体的几何特征，引入几何特征引导算法确保几何特征准确性，使用RANSAC-PnP算法处理物体尺度变化问题

Result: 在基准数据集上实验证明，该方法不仅高效，而且比之前的RGB方法达到更高的精度

Conclusion: 该方法为使用RGB图像推进类别级物体姿态估计提供了新的视角，在真实场景中无需深度数据即可实现准确姿态估计

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成任务中对引导权重高度敏感，存在训练与推理阶段的性能差距，这影响了生成样本的质量和稳定性

Method: 提出DiffIER优化框架，在推理阶段的每一步进行迭代误差最小化，减少累积误差，从而缩小训练-推理差距

Conclusion: DiffIER是一个即插即用的优化框架，能有效提升扩散模型的生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

TL;DR: OmniTry是一个统一的虚拟试穿框架，可处理任何可穿戴物品（珠宝、配饰等），采用无掩码设置，通过两阶段训练解决数据配对难题，在12类物品上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法主要关注服装，缺乏对其他可穿戴物品（如珠宝、配饰）的支持，且需要掩码标注，实用性受限。

Method: 两阶段训练流程：第一阶段利用大规模无配对图像训练无掩码定位模型，第二阶段用少量配对图像微调保持物品外观一致性。重新利用修复模型自动在合适位置绘制物品。

Result: 在包含12类常见可穿戴物品的综合基准测试中，OmniTry在物品定位和ID保持方面均优于现有方法，且第一阶段后模型即使使用少量配对样本也能快速收敛。

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，解决了多品类可穿戴物品试穿的数据挑战，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at
https://omnitry.github.io/.

TL;DR: DeH4R是一种新颖的混合模型，结合了图生成方法的效率和图增长方法的动态性，用于从遥感图像中提取道路网络图，在保持快速推理速度的同时提高了拓扑保真度和空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于分割的方法在矢量化后处理中难以保持拓扑保真度；图增长方法计算成本高；图生成方法限制了顶点的动态插入。需要一种既能保持高效推理又能实现动态顶点插入的解决方案。

Method: 将任务解耦为四个步骤：候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展。这种架构创新允许动态顶点（边）插入，同时保持快速推理速度。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。相比之前的SOTA图增长方法RNGDet++，在CityScale上APLS提高了4.62，IoU提高了10.18，同时推理速度快约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R成功解决了道路网络提取中的关键挑战，通过混合方法实现了拓扑保真度和计算效率的平衡，为地理空间计算机视觉提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

TL;DR: HumanPCR是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型在人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的三层次评估套件，包含感知、理解和推理三个层级，包含6000多个人工验证的多选题和视频推理测试，对30多个先进模型的评估显示在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比的表现，现有基准测试经常忽视人类相关视觉理解的关键技能。

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两个层级包含6000多个人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；Human-R提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据并主动提取上下文。每个问题都包含人工标注的思维链推理过程。

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。Human-R分析显示模型在从多样化人类场景中提取主动视觉证据方面存在困难，过度依赖查询引导检索。即使使用扩展视觉上下文和测试时思考等先进技术，收益也很有限。

Conclusion: HumanPCR评估套件和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和人类中心应用的发展，揭示了当前模型在人类相关视觉理解方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高昂，半监督学习能利用未标注数据生成伪标签。Mamba等状态空间模型在处理长距离依赖方面表现出色，值得探索其在医学图像分割中的应用

Method: 1) 数据层面：开发基于Mamba扫描特性的patch级弱-强混合增强；2) 网络层面：引入多样化扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3) 特征层面：采用不确定性加权的对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Result: 在Synapse数据集上，使用20%标注数据时，比最新的SSM-based方法性能提升6.69%

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过多角度多样性增强，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，证明了Mamba模型在该领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Motivation: 在线教育内容日益增多但缺乏有效组织，元宇宙为教育内容提供了沉浸式体验环境，但现有数据集规模小且检索相关元宇宙场景仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入包含457个农业主题虚拟博物馆的新数据集，每个都配有文本描述；提出分层视觉语言模型来表示和检索相关农业博物馆。

Conclusion: 该工作为农业教育元宇宙内容检索提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码已开源，有助于推动相关领域研究发展。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

TL;DR: 提出了IPGA攻击方法，通过利用投影器模块的中间阶段(Q-Former)进行更精细的对抗攻击，在保持背景的同时实现细粒度目标修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法将丰富视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击粒度，且忽视了投影器模块在视觉-语言对齐中的关键作用。

Method: IPGA方法利用仅在第一阶段预训练的Q-Former中间层，在语义有意义的视觉token上操作；提出残差查询对齐(RQA)来保护无关视觉内容。

Result: 在全局图像描述和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，并能成功迁移到Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT等商业VLM。

Conclusion: IPGA通过攻击投影器中间层实现了更精确可控的对抗操作，显著提升了攻击效果和跨模型迁移能力。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄露问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄露现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像；2）重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼，抑制信息泄露

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能，证明其通用性和实用性

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种无需额外训练或架构修改的通用实用解决方案，有效增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要关注小型家用物体和机械臂操作场景，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中面对大型物体、远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化视角的需求。

Method: 构建包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互，特别捕捉移动平台特有的远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计方法在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了该领域的数据空白。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 这是首个解决广义相机SfT问题的解决方案集，为多相机3D非刚性配准提供了有效的理论框架和实践方法

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

TL;DR: Med-CTX是基于Transformer的多模态乳腺癌超声分割框架，整合临床放射学报告提升性能和可解释性，在BUS-BRA数据集上达到99% Dice分数和95% IoU，优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个可解释的乳腺癌超声分割系统，通过整合临床文本信息来提升分割性能并增强模型的可解释性和可信度，满足计算机辅助诊断对透明度和可靠性的需求。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）进行病灶分割，结合BioClinicalBERT编码临床BI-RADS语义文本，通过跨模态注意力融合视觉和文本特征，同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断理由。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到99% Dice分数和95% IoU，显著优于U-Net、ViT和Swin基线模型。消融研究表明临床文本对分割精度和解释质量至关重要（Dice下降5.4%，CIDEr下降31%）。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过多模态融合实现了优异的乳腺癌超声分割性能和高可解释性，为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，在临床辅助诊断中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TCA框架，通过时间步压缩显著降低SNN对抗攻击延迟，相比现有方法减少56-57%延迟，同时保持攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法存在严重延迟问题，无法满足实时应用需求，因为它们直接扩展ANN范式而未充分利用SNN特性

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：时间步级反向传播(TLBP)基于发现全局时间信息对攻击成功不关键；对抗性膜电位重用(A-MPR)通过预计算和重用初始时间步的膜电位积累

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上，CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集实验显示，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少56.6%和57.1%攻击延迟，同时保持可比攻击成功率

Conclusion: TCA通过利用SNN独特特性有效解决了对抗攻击延迟问题，为实时SNN安全应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督聚类框架，结合街景图像视觉嵌入和空间种植模式来估计城市树木生物多样性，无需标注数据即可在多个城市准确恢复属级多样性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候韧性至关重要，但传统实地调查成本高昂，监督AI方法需要标注数据且跨区域泛化能力差，需要开发无需标注的 scalable 解决方案。

Method: 无监督聚类框架，整合街景图像的视觉嵌入特征和空间种植模式，无需标注数据即可估计生物多样性。

Result: 在8个北美城市应用中，该方法能够高保真地恢复属级多样性模式，Shannon和Simpson指数的Wasserstein距离低，保持了空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 这种可扩展的细粒度方法为缺乏详细清单的城市提供了生物多样性测绘能力，支持绿色公平获取和城市生态系统的适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Motivation: 智能交通检测在跨域场景下面临挑战，需要解决源域和目标域之间的域差异问题

Result: 在流行的跨域目标检测基准测试中，SA3方法取得了优于之前最先进方法的结果

Conclusion: SA3方法通过有效的对齐机制和识别策略，成功解决了跨域智能交通检测问题，展现了优越的性能

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型虽然视觉效果出色，但往往无法精确对齐文本提示，导致关键元素缺失或不同概念意外混合的问题

Method: 学习基于目标提示的高成功率分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号分量，提供细粒度控制以避免过优化和分布外伪影。该方法无需训练，可与现有扩散和流匹配架构无缝集成，并支持边界框等额外条件模态

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于当前最先进的方法

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效解决文本到图像生成中的对齐问题，提供更精确的提示跟随能力和空间对齐控制

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多使用简化的合成基准，无法反映真实世界性能，需要构建更真实的基准来评估增量学习方法。

Method: 构建了两个真实增量目标检测基准：D-RICO（固定类别但域偏移）和EC-RICO（新增域和类别），基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和合成域、不同条件、相机传感器和标注策略。

Result: 所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面都表现不佳，重放少量旧数据就能超越所有方法，但单独训练效果仍然最好。

Conclusion: 增量学习方法存在明显性能差距，归因于蒸馏中的弱教师、单模型无法处理多样化任务以及可塑性不足等问题。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新颖的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示(LCRs)来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习语义基础的表征，提高对分布偏移的鲁棒性，无需主训练集中的概念标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往在分布内表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力差，容易依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义的特征。

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量、解耦的概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的LCRs，通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在玩具数据集上显著提高对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中提升合成扰动和OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可改善模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

Motivation: 南亚雾霾事件严重影响印恒平原地区，但缺乏实时的区域性颗粒物浓度预报系统。气溶胶指数作为雾霾形成的关键指标，需要建立有效的预测模型。

Method: 利用2019-2023年Sentinel-5P气溶胶数据，采用卷积长短期记忆神经网络(ConvLSTM)模型，以340-380nm紫外气溶胶指数作为预测因子，捕捉时空相关性。

Result: 模型在5天预测间隔下取得良好效果：均方误差约0.0018，损失值约0.3995，结构相似性指数约0.74，显著优于先前模型。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型能有效预测南亚雾霾事件的气溶胶指数，为空气质量预警提供技术支持，未来可通过整合更多数据和优化架构进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 提出的SCRNet框架有效解决了医学图像分割中全局和局部特征融合的挑战，性能优于现有方法

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Result: 在复杂户外场景中超越现有最先进方法，展现出卓越性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应视角选择有效提升了3DGS模型的完整性和重建质量，为在线3D重建提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，通过显式抑制噪声成分成功解决了现有数据中毒后门攻击方法的局限性。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single

We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained

fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
