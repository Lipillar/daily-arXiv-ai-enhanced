### [1] [Deep Language Geometry: Constructing a Metric Space from LLM Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11676)
*Maksym Shamrai,Vladyslav Hamolia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM内部权重激活构建语言度量空间的新框架，通过剪枝算法自动生成高维向量表示，无需手工特征工程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖手工设计的语言学特征，需要探索利用LLM内部权重自动捕捉语言内在特性的新方法

Method: 采用改进的剪枝算法计算权重重要性分数，自动推导高维向量表示，构建语言度量空间

Result: 在106种语言上验证，结果与传统语系划分高度一致，同时揭示了可能反映历史接触或语言演化的意外语言关联

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉语言内在特征，为语言分类和演化研究提供了新的数据驱动工具

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that utilizes the internal weight activations
of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a metric space of
languages. Unlike traditional approaches based on hand-crafted linguistic
features, our method automatically derives high-dimensional vector
representations by computing weight importance scores via an adapted pruning
algorithm. Our approach captures intrinsic language characteristics that
reflect linguistic phenomena. We validate our approach across diverse datasets
and multilingual LLMs, covering 106 languages. The results align well with
established linguistic families while also revealing unexpected inter-language
connections that may indicate historical contact or language evolution. The
source code, computed language latent vectors, and visualization tool are made
publicly available at https://github.com/mshamrai/deep-language-geometry.

### [2] [Can we Evaluate RAGs with Synthetic Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11758)
*Jonas van Elburg,Peter van der Putten,Maarten Marx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM生成的合成问答数据在评估检索器配置时能可靠替代人工标注基准，但在评估生成器架构时表现不一致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索当人工标注数据不可用时，大语言模型生成的合成问答数据是否能有效替代人工标注基准来评估检索增强生成(RAG)系统

Method: 进行两个实验：1)固定生成器，变化检索器参数；2)固定检索器参数，变化生成器架构。在四个数据集(两个开放域、两个专有)上测试

Result: 合成基准在评估不同检索器配置的RAG系统时表现可靠，与人工基准结果一致；但在比较生成器架构时无法产生一致的RAG排名

Conclusion: 合成基准在评估检索器方面有效，但在评估生成器时存在任务不匹配和风格偏见问题，限制了其全面替代人工基准的能力

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large
language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled
benchmarks when such data is unavailable. We assess the reliability of
synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters
while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed
retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two
proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying
in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark
baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing
generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of
task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias
favoring certain generators.

### [3] [Limitation Learning: Catching Adverse Dialog with GAIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11767)
*Noah Kasmanoff,Rahul Zalkikar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用模仿学习从专家对话数据中训练对话策略和判别器，策略能生成对话，判别器可识别专家与合成对话的区别，揭示了对话模型的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有奖励函数的情况下，利用模仿学习从专家演示中学习对话策略，同时训练判别器来识别模型生成的对话与真实专家对话的区别

Method: 应用模仿学习框架，从专家对话数据中训练生成策略（对话策略）和判别模型（区分专家对话与合成对话）

Result: 成功训练出能够根据提示生成对话的策略，但判别器的结果显示对话模型存在明显局限性，能够识别出合成对话与真实对话的差异

Conclusion: 这种模仿学习方法可用于识别对话导向任务中任意数据模型的不良行为，为模型评估和缺陷检测提供了有效工具

Abstract: Imitation learning is a proven method for creating a policy in the absence of
rewards, by leveraging expert demonstrations. In this work, we apply imitation
learning to conversation. In doing so, we recover a policy capable of talking
to a user given a prompt (input state), and a discriminator capable of
classifying between expert and synthetic conversation. While our policy is
effective, we recover results from our discriminator that indicate the
limitations of dialog models. We argue that this technique can be used to
identify adverse behavior of arbitrary data models common for dialog oriented
tasks.

### [4] [Investigating Transcription Normalization in the Faetar ASR Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11771)
*Leo Peckham,Michael Ong,Naomi Nagy,Ewan Dunbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现Faetar ASR基准中的转录不一致性问题存在但不是主要挑战，有限词典约束解码有益，但任务仍然极其困难


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考察低资源语音识别基准Faetar中转录不一致性对任务性能的影响

Method: 使用手工构建的小型词典分析转录不一致性，测试bigram词级语言模型和有限词典约束解码的效果

Result: 转录不一致确实存在但不是主要问题，bigram语言模型无额外收益，有限词典约束解码有益

Conclusion: Faetar ASR任务极其困难，转录质量问题次要，词典约束是有效策略但不足以解决根本挑战

Abstract: We examine the role of transcription inconsistencies in the Faetar Automatic
Speech Recognition benchmark, a challenging low-resource ASR benchmark. With
the help of a small, hand-constructed lexicon, we conclude that find that,
while inconsistencies do exist in the transcriptions, they are not the main
challenge in the task. We also demonstrate that bigram word-based language
modelling is of no added benefit, but that constraining decoding to a finite
lexicon can be beneficial. The task remains extremely difficult.

### [5] [A Multi-Task Evaluation of LLMs' Processing of Academic Text Input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11779)
*Tianyi Li,Yu Qin,Olivia R. Liu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（如Google Gemini）在学术文本处理方面的能力，发现在学术同行评审等科学发现辅助任务中表现有限，不建议无限制使用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在科学发现和学术同行评审中的实际应用潜力，评估其在处理学术文本方面的能力

Method: 构建包含四个任务的评估流程：内容复现/比较/评分/反思，使用顶级信息系统期刊文章作为输入文本，采用多种文本指标进行严格性能评估

Result: Gemini在学术文本摘要和复述方面表现尚可，但在文本比较排序方面扩展性差，评分区分度低，反思缺乏深度洞察力，整体表现令人失望

Conclusion: LLM在学术文本处理能力方面存在明显局限，不支持在构建同行评审中无限制使用，需要更谨慎的应用评估

Abstract: How much large language models (LLMs) can aid scientific discovery, notably
in assisting academic peer review, is in heated debate. Between a literature
digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical
application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science
studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate
LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the
assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding
a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable
arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs
with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a
solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We
exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the
prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals
as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised
performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of
academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise
text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone
to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is
self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This
evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is
consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external
(comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the
variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs
in constructing peer reviews.

### [6] [LLM-Guided Planning and Summary-Based Scientific Text Simplification: DS@GT at CLEF 2025 SimpleText](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11816)
*Krishna Chaitanya Marturi,Heba H. Elwazzan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的两阶段科学文本简化方法，分别在句子级别和文档级别进行简化，通过结构化规划和摘要指导来提高简化的一致性和上下文忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学文本简化任务中保持上下文一致性和忠实度的挑战，为CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 1提供有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用大语言模型进行两阶段处理：句子级别先生成结构化规划再进行规划驱动的简化；文档级别先生成摘要然后用摘要指导简化过程。

Result: 开发了一个能够产生更连贯和上下文忠实的科学文本简化的框架。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的两阶段方法在科学文本简化任务中表现出色，能够有效提升简化质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 1,
which addresses both sentence-level and document-level scientific text
simplification. For sentence-level simplification, our methodology employs
large language models (LLMs) to first generate a structured plan, followed by
plan-driven simplification of individual sentences. At the document level, we
leverage LLMs to produce concise summaries and subsequently guide the
simplification process using these summaries. This two-stage, LLM-based
framework enables more coherent and contextually faithful simplifications of
scientific text.

### [7] [Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in Scientific Text Simplification using Ensemble Approaches: DS@GT at CLEF 2025 SimpleText](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11823)
*Krishna Chaitanya Marturi,Heba H. Elwazzan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种集成多策略的方法来检测科学文本简化中的创造性生成和信息扭曲，包括BERT分类器、语义相似度、自然语言推理和LLM推理，并通过元分类器组合信号，同时使用LLM后编辑系统进行基于原文的修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 2中科学文本简化过程中的创造性生成检测和信息扭曲评估问题，需要开发一个能够准确识别简化文本中可能存在的虚假信息和内容失真的系统。

Method: 构建集成框架，结合BERT分类器、语义相似度测量、自然语言推理模型和大型语言模型(LLM)推理，使用元分类器整合这些多样化信号；对于基于原文的生成，采用LLM后编辑系统来根据原始输入文本修订简化内容。

Result: 该方法通过多策略集成增强了虚假信息和扭曲检测的鲁棒性，能够有效识别科学文本简化过程中的创造性生成内容和信息失真现象。

Conclusion: 提出的集成框架和LLM后编辑系统为科学文本简化任务中的内容真实性检测提供了有效的解决方案，通过多种技术手段的组合提高了检测准确性和系统可靠性。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our methodology for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task
2, which focuses on detecting and evaluating creative generation and
information distortion in scientific text simplification. Our solution
integrates multiple strategies: we construct an ensemble framework that
leverages BERT-based classifier, semantic similarity measure, natural language
inference model, and large language model (LLM) reasoning. These diverse
signals are combined using meta-classifiers to enhance the robustness of
spurious and distortion detection. Additionally, for grounded generation, we
employ an LLM-based post-editing system that revises simplifications based on
the original input texts.

### [8] [A Survey of Idiom Datasets for Psycholinguistic and Computational Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11828)
*Michael Flor,Xinyi Liu,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了53个习语研究数据集，涵盖心理语言学和计算语言学领域，分析了数据集的内容、形式和用途，发现两个领域的研究尚未建立有效联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语作为无法从字面推断含义的比喻表达，在计算处理和人类实验研究中都面临挑战，需要系统梳理现有研究资源来推动该领域发展。

Method: 系统回顾了心理语言学和计算语言学领域的53个习语数据集，分析其注释实践、覆盖范围和任务框架，比较不同维度的评级标准和研究重点。

Result: 心理语言学资源主要包含熟悉度、透明度和组合性等维度的标准化评级，而计算数据集支持习语性检测、释义和跨语言建模等任务。近期研究扩展了语言覆盖和任务多样性。

Conclusion: 尽管近期努力扩展了语言覆盖和任务多样性，但心理语言学和计算语言学在习语研究方面尚未建立有效联系，需要更多跨学科合作来推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Idioms are figurative expressions whose meanings often cannot be inferred
from their individual words, making them difficult to process computationally
and posing challenges for human experimental studies. This survey reviews
datasets developed in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics for
studying idioms, focusing on their content, form, and intended use.
Psycholinguistic resources typically contain normed ratings along dimensions
such as familiarity, transparency, and compositionality, while computational
datasets support tasks like idiomaticity detection/classification,
paraphrasing, and cross-lingual modeling. We present trends in annotation
practices, coverage, and task framing across 53 datasets. Although recent
efforts expanded language coverage and task diversity, there seems to be no
relation yet between psycholinguistic and computational research on idioms.

### [9] [Every 28 Days the AI Dreams of Soft Skin and Burning Stars: Scaffolding AI Agents with Hormones and Emotions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11829)
*Leigh Levinson,Christopher J. Agostino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过模拟月经和昼夜节律周期来增强AI系统的上下文相关性处理能力，发现激素周期可以作为自然的相关性过滤器，在多个基准测试中显示出与生物预期一致的性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统在处理指数级可能性空间时确定上下文相关信息的框架问题，借鉴生物节律作为自然的相关性过滤机制。

Method: 开发了一个框架，通过周期性函数模拟关键激素（雌激素、睾酮、皮质醇）生成系统提示，将模拟的月经和昼夜节律周期嵌入到大型语言模型中。

Result: 语言分析显示情感和风格变化与生物阶段相关：经期悲伤情绪达到峰值，排卵期快乐情绪占主导，昼夜模式显示从早晨乐观转向夜间内省。在SQuAD、MMLU、Hellaswag和AI2-ARC基准测试中表现出与生物预期一致的微妙但持续的性能变化，最佳功能出现在中等而非极端激素范围内。

Conclusion: 该方法为上下文AI提供了新颖的途径，同时揭示了语言模型中嵌入的关于性别和生物学的社会偏见。

Abstract: Despite significant advances, AI systems struggle with the frame problem:
determining what information is contextually relevant from an exponentially
large possibility space. We hypothesize that biological rhythms, particularly
hormonal cycles, serve as natural relevance filters that could address this
fundamental challenge. We develop a framework that embeds simulated menstrual
and circadian cycles into Large Language Models through system prompts
generated from periodic functions modeling key hormones including estrogen,
testosterone, and cortisol. Across multiple state-of-the-art models, linguistic
analysis reveals emotional and stylistic variations that track biological
phases; sadness peaks during menstruation while happiness dominates ovulation
and circadian patterns show morning optimism transitioning to nocturnal
introspection. Benchmarking on SQuAD, MMLU, Hellaswag, and AI2-ARC demonstrates
subtle but consistent performance variations aligning with biological
expectations, including optimal function in moderate rather than extreme
hormonal ranges. This methodology provides a novel approach to contextual AI
while revealing how societal biases regarding gender and biology are embedded
within language models.

### [10] [When Does Language Transfer Help? Sequential Fine-Tuning for Cross-Lingual Euphemism Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11831)
*Julia Sammartino,Libby Barak,Jing Peng,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究通过顺序微调进行跨语言迁移对委婉语检测的影响，发现在高资源语言L1上微调后再在低资源语言L2上微调能显著提升性能，特别是对约鲁巴语和土耳其语等低资源语言。XLM-R效果更好但对预训练差距敏感，mBERT更稳定但性能较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 委婉语具有文化差异性和歧义性，对语言模型特别是低资源环境下的处理构成挑战，需要研究跨语言迁移策略来改善多语言委婉语检测。

Method: 使用XLM-R和mBERT模型，比较顺序微调、单语微调和同时微调三种策略，在英语、西班牙语、中文、土耳其语和约鲁巴语五种语言上评估委婉语检测性能，分析语言配对、类型学特征和预训练覆盖度的影响。

Result: 顺序微调使用高资源L1语言能显著提升L2语言性能，特别是对低资源语言如约鲁巴语和土耳其语。XLM-R获得更大提升但对预训练差距和灾难性遗忘更敏感，mBERT结果更稳定但性能较低。

Conclusion: 顺序微调是一种简单有效的策略，可显著改善多语言模型在委婉语检测方面的性能，特别是在涉及低资源语言时。

Abstract: Euphemisms are culturally variable and often ambiguous, posing challenges for
language models, especially in low-resource settings. This paper investigates
how cross-lingual transfer via sequential fine-tuning affects euphemism
detection across five languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish, and
Yoruba. We compare sequential fine-tuning with monolingual and simultaneous
fine-tuning using XLM-R and mBERT, analyzing how performance is shaped by
language pairings, typological features, and pretraining coverage. Results show
that sequential fine-tuning with a high-resource L1 improves L2 performance,
especially for low-resource languages like Yoruba and Turkish. XLM-R achieves
larger gains but is more sensitive to pretraining gaps and catastrophic
forgetting, while mBERT yields more stable, though lower, results. These
findings highlight sequential fine-tuning as a simple yet effective strategy
for improving euphemism detection in multilingual models, particularly when
low-resource languages are involved.

### [11] [SupraTok: Cross-Boundary Tokenization for Enhanced Language Model Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11857)
*Andrei-Valentin Tănase,Elena Pelican*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SupraTok是一种新颖的分词架构，通过跨边界模式学习、熵驱动数据筛选和多阶段课程学习，实现了比OpenAI和Google分词器更高的效率，在保持多语言竞争力的同时显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分词方法作为NLP基础组件发展滞后，尽管模型架构进步显著，但分词策略基本保持静态，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 基于Byte-Pair Encoding扩展，学习"superword"多词语义单元，采用跨边界模式学习发现语义单元、熵驱动数据优化训练语料质量、多阶段课程学习确保稳定收敛。

Result: 英语分词效率提升31%（5.91 vs 4.51字符/词元），优于OpenAI o200k和Google Gemma 3分词器。在GPT-2规模模型上，HellaSWAG提升8.4%，MMLU提升9.5%。

Conclusion: 高效分词可以作为架构创新的补充路径来提升语言模型性能，但在更大规模模型上需要进一步验证。

Abstract: Tokenization remains a fundamental yet underexplored bottleneck in natural
language processing, with strategies largely static despite remarkable progress
in model architectures. We present SupraTok, a novel tokenization architecture
that reimagines subword segmentation through three innovations: cross-boundary
pattern learning that discovers multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data
curation that optimizes training corpus quality, and multi-phase curriculum
learning for stable convergence. Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by
learning "superword" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve
semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31%
improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per
token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's
Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance
across 38 languages. When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters)
trained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4%
improvement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural
modifications. While these results are promising at this scale, further
validation at larger model scales is needed. These findings suggest that
efficient tokenization can complement architectural innovations as a path to
improved language model performance.

### [12] [In-Context Examples Matter: Improving Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11889)
*Hui Ma,Bo Zhang,Jinpeng Hu,Zenglin Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出InitERC，一种简单有效的一阶段上下文指令调优框架，用于对话情感识别，通过上下文示例学习说话者-上下文-情感对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多阶段指令调优方法无法联合捕捉说话者特征和对话上下文之间的动态交互，导致在统一框架内说话者身份、上下文线索和情感状态之间的对齐较弱

Method: InitERC框架包含四个组件：演示池构建、上下文示例选择、提示模板设计和上下文指令调优。通过上下文指令调优使大语言模型从上下文示例中学习说话者-上下文-情感对齐

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行大量实验，证明InitERC相比最先进的基线方法取得了显著改进

Conclusion: InitERC是一个简单而有效的一阶段框架，能够更好地实现说话者特征、上下文信息和情感状态之间的联合对齐

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims to identify the emotion of
each utterance in a conversation, playing a vital role in empathetic artificial
intelligence. With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction
tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC. Existing studies mainly
focus on multi-stage instruction tuning, which first endows LLMs with speaker
characteristics, and then conducts context-aware instruction tuning to
comprehend emotional states. However, these methods inherently constrains the
capacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker
characteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among
speaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified
framework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage
in-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn
speaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context
instruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e.,
demonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template
design, and in-context instruction tuning. To explore the impact of in-context
examples, we conduct a comprehensive study on three key factors: retrieval
strategy, example ordering, and the number of examples. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that our proposed InitERC achieves
substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.

### [13] [CORE: Measuring Multi-Agent LLM Interaction Quality under Game-Theoretic Pressures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11915)
*Punya Syon Pandey,Yongjin Yang,Jiarui Liu,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CORE指标来量化多智能体系统中语言使用的有效性，通过分析合作、竞争和中性设置下的LLM对话，发现合作设置表现出更多的词汇重复和扩展，而竞争交互则词汇更受限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体之间的博弈交互虽然展现出许多涌现能力，但语言多样性尚未得到充分量化，需要一种指标来评估多智能体系统中的语言使用效果。

Method: 提出CORE指标，整合聚类熵、词汇重复和语义相似度度量，应用于竞争、合作和中性设置的成对LLM对话，并基于Zipf定律和Heaps定律分析词频分布和词汇增长。

Result: 合作设置表现出更陡峭的Zipf分布和更高的Heap指数，表明更多重复同时词汇扩展更大；竞争交互显示较低的Zipf和Heaps指数，反映较少重复和更受限的词汇。

Conclusion: 社会激励影响语言适应，CORE可作为测量多智能体LLM系统语言鲁棒性的强大诊断工具。

Abstract: Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs)
have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these
interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present
the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the
effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different
game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy,
lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog
quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative,
and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws
to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our
findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions
and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater
vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf
and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained
vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives
influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for
measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is
available at https://github.com/psyonp/core.

### [14] [LLMs Struggle with NLI for Perfect Aspect: A Cross-Linguistic Study in Chinese and Japanese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11927)
*Jie Lu,Du Jin,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 构建中文和日语的完成体NLI数据集，发现先进LLM在时态推理方面存在困难，特别是在检测细微的时态和参考时间变化方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文和日语缺乏英语那样明确的完成体时态标记形式，这给自然语言推理带来了挑战，需要专门的数据集来评估模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 构建基于语言学动机的模板化NLI数据集（每种语言1,350对样本），专注于完成体在中文和日语中的表达。

Result: 实验显示即使是先进的LLM在时态推理方面也表现不佳，特别是在检测细微的时态和参考时间变化方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了模型在时态语义理解方面的局限性，强调了跨语言评估的重要性，数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: Unlike English, which uses distinct forms (e.g., had, has, will have) to mark
the perfect aspect across tenses, Chinese and Japanese lack separate
grammatical forms for tense within the perfect aspect, which complicates
Natural Language Inference (NLI). Focusing on the perfect aspect in these
languages, we construct a linguistically motivated, template-based NLI dataset
(1,350 pairs per language). Experiments reveal that even advanced LLMs struggle
with temporal inference, particularly in detecting subtle tense and
reference-time shifts. These findings highlight model limitations and
underscore the need for cross-linguistic evaluation in temporal semantics. Our
dataset is available at https://github.com/Lujie2001/CrossNLI.

### [15] [CAMF: Collaborative Adversarial Multi-agent Framework for Machine Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11933)
*Yue Wang,Liesheng Wei,Yuxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAMF是一个多智能体框架，通过协作对抗方式检测机器生成文本，在零样本检测中显著优于现有技术


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本检测方法存在分析浅层、缺乏多维度一致性检查的问题，需要更深入检测机器生成文本

Method: 使用多个LLM智能体进行三阶段协作：多维度语言特征提取、对抗一致性探测、综合判断聚合

Result: 实证评估显示CAMF在零样本MGT检测技术上具有显著优势

Conclusion: CAMF框架通过多智能体协作对抗分析，能够有效检测机器生成文本，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) from contemporary Large Language
Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial amid risks like disinformation and
threats to academic integrity. Existing zero-shot detection paradigms, despite
their practicality, often exhibit significant deficiencies. Key challenges
include: (1) superficial analyses focused on limited textual attributes, and
(2) a lack of investigation into consistency across linguistic dimensions such
as style, semantics, and logic. To address these challenges, we introduce the
\textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{M}ulti-agent
\textbf{F}ramework (\textbf{CAMF}), a novel architecture using multiple
LLM-based agents. CAMF employs specialized agents in a synergistic three-phase
process: \emph{Multi-dimensional Linguistic Feature Extraction},
\emph{Adversarial Consistency Probing}, and \emph{Synthesized Judgment
Aggregation}. This structured collaborative-adversarial process enables a deep
analysis of subtle, cross-dimensional textual incongruities indicative of
non-human origin. Empirical evaluations demonstrate CAMF's significant
superiority over state-of-the-art zero-shot MGT detection techniques.

### [16] [Learning Wisdom from Errors: Promoting LLM's Continual Relation Learning through Exploiting Error Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12031)
*Shaozhe Yin,Jinyu Guo,Kai Shuang,Xia Liu,Ruize Ou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于指令的持续对比调优方法，通过分析错误案例来改进大型语言模型在持续关系抽取中的表现，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续关系抽取方法主要使用记忆回放和对比学习，但忽视了错误案例对揭示模型认知偏差的重要性

Method: 将训练和记忆数据按初始响应的正确性分成两部分，采用双任务微调，利用LLM的指令跟随能力进行指令式对比调优

Result: 在TACRED和FewRel数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著提升了持续关系抽取的表现

Conclusion: 专门利用错误案例对于改进持续关系抽取模型性能具有重要意义

Abstract: Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) aims to continually learn new emerging
relations while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing CRE methods mainly
use memory replay and contrastive learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
However, these methods do not attach importance to the error cases that can
reveal the model's cognitive biases more effectively. To address this issue, we
propose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large
Language Models (LLMs) in CRE. Different from existing CRE methods that
typically handle the training and memory data in a unified manner, this
approach splits the training and memory data of each task into two parts
respectively based on the correctness of the initial responses and treats them
differently through dual-task fine-tuning. In addition, leveraging the
advantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel
instruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct
current cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an
instruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new
relations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model
on TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new
state-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating
the importance of specializing in exploiting error cases.

TL;DR: FineCE是一种新颖的细粒度置信度估计方法，通过监督学习和后向置信度集成策略，为LLM生成过程提供准确的连续置信度分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缺乏自我意识且经常过度自信，现有置信度估计方法只能提供粗粒度的评分，无法在生成过程中提供细粒度的连续置信度估计

Method: 1) 开发构建训练数据的完整流程以捕捉LLM响应的概率分布；2) 以监督方式训练模型预测任意文本序列的置信度分数；3) 提出后向置信度集成(BCI)策略利用后续文本信息增强当前序列的置信度估计；4) 引入三种策略识别生成过程中的最佳置信度估计位置

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FineCE始终优于现有的经典置信度估计方法

Conclusion: FineCE通过细粒度的置信度估计显著提升了LLM生成输出的可信度和可靠性，为解决LLM过度自信问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse tasks, they fundamentally lack self-awareness and frequently
exhibit overconfidence, assigning high confidence scores to incorrect
predictions. Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing
the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing
approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide
fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation
process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence
estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during
text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for
constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying
probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict
confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner.
Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that
leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation
for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies
for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the
generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence
estimation methods. Our code and all baselines used in the paper are available
on GitHub.

TL;DR: J6方法通过雅可比矩阵分解为六个可解释组件，为多目标LLM优化提供结构化梯度分析框架，解决事实性和置信度平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多目标优化方法依赖标量梯度聚合，忽略了目标与参数间的几何结构，无法有效处理目标冲突和协同

Method: 提出J6结构化雅可比方法，将梯度交互矩阵分解为6个可解释组件，支持硬决策(argmax)和软策略(softmax)的动态更新框架

Result: 该方法提供了参数归因、任务干扰和几何对齐适应的洞察，形成了冲突感知的提示优化机制

Conclusion: J6为多目标神经调优引入了结构化雅可比推理的新途径，提供了原则性和可扩展的优化机制

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) adaptation, balancing multiple optimization
objectives such as improving factuality (heat) and increasing confidence (via
low entropy) poses a fundamental challenge, especially when prompt parameters
(e.g., hidden-layer insertions h and embedding modifications w) interact in
non-trivial ways. Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely
on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between
objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method
that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable
components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g.,
choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g.,
attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update
framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the
interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task
interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled
and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a
new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective
neural tuning.

TL;DR: STEM是一个轻量级评估框架，通过分析同架构不同规模LLM的性能转变样本来高效评估模型相对能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试存在过拟合问题且计算成本高，难以有效区分模型间的真实能力差异

Method: 识别显著转变样本(STS)，通过分析同架构不同参数规模模型的性能一致转变来构建评估样本池

Result: STEM能可靠捕捉性能趋势，与模型能力真实排名一致，在六个多样化基准上验证有效

Conclusion: STEM是实用且可扩展的细粒度、架构无关的LLM评估方法

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher
scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect
enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to
public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made
it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences
between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured
\textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight
and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative
capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples}
(STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same
architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to
effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model
family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative
benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM
reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of
model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable
method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗AI系统的发展，需要理解计算资源（思维预算）如何影响医学推理质量，以优化资源分配并满足不同临床场景的需求。

Method: 系统评估Qwen3（1.7B-235B参数）和DeepSeek-R1（1.5B-70B参数）两个模型家族在15个医学数据集上的表现，控制思维预算从零到无限制token进行实验。

Result: 发现了三个效率区间：高效率（0-256 token）适合实时应用，平衡（256-512 token）提供最佳性价比，高精度（512+ token）仅适用于关键诊断任务。小模型从扩展思维中获益更大（15-20%提升 vs 大模型的5-10%）。

Conclusion: 思维预算控制是优化医疗AI系统的关键机制，能够根据临床需求动态分配资源，同时保持医疗部署所需的透明度，该概念在不同架构间具有普适性。

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget
mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws
between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically
evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and
DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning
diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with
thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish
logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a
predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings
identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)
suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering
optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and
high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.
Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from
extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger
models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides
greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific
patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring
significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory
medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our
proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of
thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking
budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems,
enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while
maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨使用LLM作为隐私评估器的可行性，通过比较LLM与人类对文本隐私敏感性的判断，发现LLM能够准确模拟人类隐私视角，为隐私保护NLP提供新的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私保护NLP领域面临隐私评估的挑战，传统方法难以准确衡量隐私敏感性。受LLM在其他NLP子领域成功应用的启发，研究探索LLM作为隐私评估器的潜力。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge范式，在10个数据集上使用13个LLM模型，并与677名人类参与者的隐私判断进行对比分析，研究人类与LLM的推理模式差异。

Result: 隐私确实难以量化测量，人类间一致性较低。但LLM能够准确建模全球人类隐私视角，在隐私评估方面表现出与人类高度一致的能力。

Conclusion: LLM作为隐私评估器具有可行性，为解决隐私保护的核心挑战提供了创新技术方案，但需要进一步分析其优缺点和适用范围。

Abstract: Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language
Processing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of
privacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a
promising approach $\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in
other subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$
paradigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language
evaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators.
Recognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we
investigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the
privacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM
evaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a
study involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we
confirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically,
exhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find
that LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through
an analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and
limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our
findings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy
evaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with
innovative technical solutions.

Motivation: 东南亚地区拥有近7亿人口，但缺乏针对该地区的句子嵌入基准测试，现有数据集多为机器翻译，缺乏原生语言特性，需要建立专门的评估标准。

Method: 构建SEA-BED基准测试，包含169个人工构建的数据集，覆盖10种东南亚语言和9个任务类型，评估17个嵌入模型，分析任务难度、语言性能差距和翻译质量影响。

Result: 研究发现东南亚语言存在显著的排名变化和模型性能不一致性，人工标注数据集对缅甸语等低资源语言尤为重要，机器翻译与人工翻译存在明显性能差异。

Conclusion: SEA-BED填补了东南亚地区嵌入基准测试的空白，强调了人工构建数据集的重要性，揭示了该地区语言的独特评估需求，为未来模型开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are essential for NLP tasks such as semantic search,
re-ranking, and textual similarity. Although multilingual benchmarks like MMTEB
broaden coverage, Southeast Asia (SEA) datasets are scarce and often
machine-translated, missing native linguistic properties. With nearly 700
million speakers, the SEA region lacks a region-specific embedding benchmark.
We introduce SEA-BED, the first large-scale SEA embedding benchmark with 169
datasets across 9 tasks and 10 languages, where 71% are formulated by humans,
not machine generation or translation. We address three research questions: (1)
which SEA languages and tasks are challenging, (2) whether SEA languages show
unique performance gaps globally, and (3) how human vs. machine translations
affect evaluation. We evaluate 17 embedding models across six studies,
analyzing task and language challenges, cross-benchmark comparisons, and
translation trade-offs. Results show sharp ranking shifts, inconsistent model
performance among SEA languages, and the importance of human-curated datasets
for low-resource languages like Burmese.

Motivation: 虽然语音基础模型在各类任务上表现出色，但对其获取的知识理解滞后，且缺乏对需要深层理解的口语理解任务的充分探索。

Method: 使用统计工具和无训练任务的分析框架，比较多个SFMs；为口语理解评估基准贡献了命名实体识别和定位任务；开发基于SFMs的端到端方法。

Conclusion: 该论文解决了关于SFMs的未解问题，提供了工具和数据集来促进理解，并为未来模型开发和采用提供了明智的设计选择。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose
representations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five
years have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and
supervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream
tasks.
  Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the
knowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis
framework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the
acoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a
comparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also
shows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream
task performance.
  The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on
speech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to
spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding
than widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration
of SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this
thesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER)
and named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding
Evaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find
that end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded
(speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate
E2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on
task performance.
  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs,
providing tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the
community to make informed design choices for future model development and
adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning across diverse domains. However, effective reasoning in real-world
tasks requires adapting the reasoning strategy to the demands of the problem,
ranging from fast, intuitive responses to deliberate, step-by-step reasoning
and tool-augmented thinking. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we
propose a novel taxonomy of LLM reasoning strategies along two knowledge
boundaries: a fast/slow boundary separating intuitive from deliberative
processes, and an internal/external boundary distinguishing reasoning grounded
in the model's parameters from reasoning augmented by external tools. We
systematically survey recent work on adaptive reasoning in LLMs and categorize
methods based on key decision factors. We conclude by highlighting open
challenges and future directions toward more adaptive, efficient, and reliable
LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on tasks that test their
knowledge or reasoning abilities. In this paper, we explore a different type of
evaluation: whether an LLM can predict aspects of its own responses. Since LLMs
lack the ability to execute themselves, we introduce the Self-Execution
Benchmark, which measures a model's ability to anticipate properties of its
output, such as whether a question will be difficult for it, whether it will
refuse to answer, or what kinds of associations it is likely to produce. Our
experiments show that models generally perform poorly on this benchmark, and
that increased model size or capability does not consistently lead to better
performance. These results suggest a fundamental limitation in how LLMs
represent and reason about their own behavior.

Conclusion: LegalΔ框架有效解决了法律AI推理的可解释性问题，通过强化学习和信息增益机制显著提升了法律推理的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) has achieved notable advances in
automating judicial decision-making with the support of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and
interpretable reasoning processes. They often default to fast-thinking behavior
by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting
their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous
justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\Delta$, a
reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through
chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$\Delta$
employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and
reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This
encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than
generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$\Delta$ follows a
two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a
powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning
quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward
mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity.
Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that
Legal$\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and
interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal
judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be
released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.

Abstract: Probation is a crucial institution in modern criminal law, embodying the
principles of fairness and justice while contributing to the harmonious
development of society. Despite its importance, the current Intelligent
Judicial Assistant System (IJAS) lacks dedicated methods for probation
prediction, and research on the underlying factors influencing probation
eligibility remains limited. In addition, probation eligibility requires a
comprehensive analysis of both criminal circumstances and remorse. Much of the
existing research in IJAS relies primarily on data-driven methodologies, which
often overlooks the legal logic underpinning judicial decision-making. To
address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates legal logic into
deep learning models for probation prediction, implemented in three distinct
stages. First, we construct a specialized probation dataset that includes fact
descriptions and probation legal elements (PLEs). Second, we design a distinct
probation prediction model named the Multi-Task Dual-Theory Probation
Prediction Model (MT-DT), which is grounded in the legal logic of probation and
the \textit{Dual-Track Theory of Punishment}. Finally, our experiments on the
probation dataset demonstrate that the MT-DT model outperforms baseline models,
and an analysis of the underlying legal logic further validates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 将Transformer编码器-解码器模型转换为低延迟流式语音识别模型的方法，通过LoRA微调和因果编码器改造实现实时转录


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型如Whisper和Canary虽然离线转录性能优秀，但无法满足流式实时转录需求，因为其架构和训练方法不适合低延迟场景

Method: 使用LoRA微调技术将非因果编码器转换为因果编码器，利用弱对齐数据集同时微调编码器和解码器，并设计新的推理机制支持贪心和束搜索解码

Result: 在低延迟块大小（<300ms）下，微调模型在大多数情况下优于现有非微调流式方法，且复杂度更低，同时能获得更好的对齐效果和词级时间戳

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功将离线ASR模型转换为高效流式模型，为流式语音识别研究提供了可行的解决方案和开源代码支持

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen remarkable progress, with models
like OpenAI Whisper and NVIDIA Canary achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance in offline transcription. However, these models are not designed
for streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their
architecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the
transformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is
careless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not
straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency
streaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder
to a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated
inference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to
yield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal.
Experiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in
most cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our
training process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for
extracting word-level timestamps. We release our training and inference code,
along with the fine-tuned models, to support further research and development
in streaming ASR.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NATCONFQA基准测试，用于评估LLM在多答案问答任务中处理冲突答案的能力，发现现有模型在冲突处理方面存在脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多答案问答任务中可能存在冲突答案，现有数据集构建成本高且多为合成数据，需要更现实的冲突感知评估基准。

Method: 利用事实核查数据集构建NATCONFQA基准，要求模型不仅识别所有有效答案，还要检测特定的冲突答案对。

Result: 评估了8个高端LLM，发现它们在处理各种类型冲突时表现脆弱，并采用了有缺陷的解决策略。

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的冲突感知问答模型，NATCONFQA为这一研究方向提供了现实的评估基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in question
answering (QA) tasks. However, Multi-Answer Question Answering (MAQA), where a
question may have several valid answers, remains challenging. Traditional QA
settings often assume consistency across evidences, but MAQA can involve
conflicting answers. Constructing datasets that reflect such conflicts is
costly and labor-intensive, while existing benchmarks often rely on synthetic
data, restrict the task to yes/no questions, or apply unverified automated
annotation. To advance research in this area, we extend the conflict-aware MAQA
setting to require models not only to identify all valid answers, but also to
detect specific conflicting answer pairs, if any. To support this task, we
introduce a novel cost-effective methodology for leveraging fact-checking
datasets to construct NATCONFQA, a new benchmark for realistic, conflict-aware
MAQA, enriched with detailed conflict labels, for all answer pairs. We evaluate
eight high-end LLMs on NATCONFQA, revealing their fragility in handling various
types of conflicts and the flawed strategies they employ to resolve them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型(SLMs)成本低但推理能力有限，现有方法往往在推理能力、自主性和泛化性三个方面做出妥协，需要新的解决方案

Method: 提出ReaLM框架：1) MRPV多路径验证对比正负推理路径；2) EAAI渐进式自主训练逐步减少外部依赖；3) 引导式思维链蒸馏编码领域知识

Result: 在垂直领域和通用推理任务上的大量实验表明，ReaLM显著提升了小语言模型在推理能力、自主性和泛化性三个方面的表现

Conclusion: ReaLM为小语言模型提供了有效的强化学习解决方案，通过创新的训练策略实现了推理能力的全面提升，具有重要的应用价值

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are a cost-effective alternative to Large
Language Models (LLMs), but often struggle with complex reasoning due to their
limited capacity and a tendency to produce mistakes or inconsistent answers
during multi-step reasoning. Existing efforts have improved SLM performance,
but typically at the cost of one or more of three key aspects: (1) reasoning
capability, due to biased supervision that filters out negative reasoning paths
and limits learning from errors; (2) autonomy, due to over-reliance on
externally generated reasoning signals; and (3) generalization, which suffers
when models overfit to teacher-specific patterns. In this paper, we introduce
ReaLM, a reinforcement learning framework for robust and self-sufficient
reasoning in vertical domains. To enhance reasoning capability, we propose
Multi-Route Process Verification (MRPV), which contrasts both positive and
negative reasoning paths to extract decisive patterns. To reduce reliance on
external guidance and improve autonomy, we introduce Enabling Autonomy via
Asymptotic Induction (EAAI), a training strategy that gradually fades external
signals. To improve generalization, we apply guided chain-of-thought
distillation to encode domain-specific rules and expert knowledge into SLM
parameters, making them part of what the model has learned. Extensive
experiments on both vertical and general reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReaLM
significantly improves SLM performance across aspects (1)-(3) above.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱构建方法泛化性有限，或简单聚合LLM输出，忽略了医学知识的时序动态性和上下文不确定性，需要能够处理知识演化的解决方案。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct模型驱动的两个专业代理：提取代理识别知识三元组并分配置信度，构建代理基于置信度和时间戳增量整合三元组到时间演化图谱中。

Result: 构建了包含156,275个实体和2,971,384个关系三元组的KG，准确性接近90%，在7个医学问答基准测试中显著提升RAG性能，支持药物重定位等应用。

Conclusion: MedKGent框架成功解决了医学知识图谱构建中的时序动态性问题，提供了高质量、可追溯的知识基础设施，在多个下游任务中展现出实用价值。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for
structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated
reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods
often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively
aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical
corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty
of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a
LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs.
Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we
simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time
series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two
specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor
Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via
sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions
and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally
integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by
confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve
conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational
triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts
demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To
evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question
answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing
significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further
demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via
confidence-aware causal inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PASC（COVID-19后遗症）诊断困难，因其症状多样且随时间变化，需要高效准确的方法从临床笔记中提取症状信息。

Method: 开发混合NLP管道：整合基于规则的命名实体识别和基于BERT的断言检测模块；构建全面的PASC词典；使用RECOVER倡议网络的11个医疗系统数据，包括160份开发评估笔记和47,654份流行性研究笔记。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且高效，展示了改善PASC诊断的潜力，模型在多个医疗系统中表现稳定，处理速度快，适合大规模应用。

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently diagnosing Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)
remains challenging due to its myriad symptoms that evolve over long- and
variable-time intervals. To address this issue, we developed a hybrid natural
language processing pipeline that integrates rule-based named entity
recognition with BERT-based assertion detection modules for PASC-symptom
extraction and assertion detection from clinical notes. We developed a
comprehensive PASC lexicon with clinical specialists. From 11 health systems of
the RECOVER initiative network across the U.S., we curated 160 intake progress
notes for model development and evaluation, and collected 47,654 progress notes
for a population-level prevalence study. We achieved an average F1 score of
0.82 in one-site internal validation and 0.76 in 10-site external validation
for assertion detection. Our pipeline processed each note at $2.448\pm 0.812$
seconds on average. Spearman correlation tests showed $\rho >0.83$ for positive
mentions and $\rho >0.72$ for negative ones, both with $P <0.0001$. These
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and their potential
for improving PASC diagnosis.

TL;DR: ZigzagAttention通过将检索头和流式头分离到不同层来优化KV缓存，在减少延迟的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型处理长上下文时KV缓存消耗巨大，现有方法通过区分重要检索头和不重要流式头来减少内存占用，但混合头在同一层会导致额外的张量访问延迟。

Method: 设计新标准强制将检索头和流式头分别聚集在不同层，避免混合头带来的额外延迟，实现ZigzagAttention方法。

Result: 该方法显著降低了延迟，性能损失可忽略不计，在基准测试中表现竞争力强。

Conclusion: 通过层间头类型分离的优化策略，有效解决了KV缓存优化中的延迟问题，实现了效率与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), handling long
context has become one of the vital abilities in LLMs. Such long-context
ability is accompanied by difficulties in deployment, especially due to the
increased consumption of KV cache. There is certain work aiming to optimize the
memory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads
can be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and
streaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the
streaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would
largely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However,
since employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one
large round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly
bring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition,
we impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval
and streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively
retrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we
further eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance
degradation. Our method named \textsc{ZigzagAttention} is competitive among
considered baselines owing to reduced latency and comparable performance.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型具有文化基因，GPT-4展现西方个人主义倾向，ERNIE Bot展现东方集体主义倾向，两者在文化维度上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在全球部署，但其文化伦理假设未被充分探索，需要研究LLMs如何反映训练语料的文化价值取向。

Method: 提出文化基因概念，构建包含200个提示的文化探测数据集，比较GPT-4和ERNIE Bot在个人主义-集体主义和权力距离两个文化维度的表现。

Result: GPT-4呈现个人主义(1.21)和低权力距离(-1.05)倾向，ERNIE Bot呈现集体主义(-0.89)和高权力距离(0.76)倾向，差异显著(p<0.001)。

Conclusion: LLMs是其文化语料的统计镜像，需要文化意识评估和部署以避免算法文化霸权。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying
cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of
a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from
their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200
prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions:
Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized
zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an
Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and
consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic
and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx
-1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance
tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically
significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI)
against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the
USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns
more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative
analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how
these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs
function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate
culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural
hegemony.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在多样化任务中成功进行上下文学习的内在机制，特别是利用物理系统这一具有结构化动态特性的真实世界测试平台来研究其涌现的推理行为。

Method: 使用物理系统的动力学预测任务作为代理任务，评估LLMs的上下文学习能力；通过稀疏自编码器(SAEs)分析模型残差流激活，识别编码的物理概念。

Result: 发现动力学预测性能随输入上下文长度增加而提升；SAEs捕获的特征与能量等关键物理变量相关，证明LLMs在上下文学习中编码了有意义的物理概念。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解LLMs如何在上下文中学习提供了新颖的案例研究，拓宽了对大语言模型学习机制的认识，特别是在物理推理方面的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的发展受限于人工标注的高成本和一致性差的问题，传统SFT和偏好优化方法难以有效利用模型自身生成空间来识别高价值的困难负样本。

Method: 提出M3PO方法，通过多模态对齐分数(MAS)和模型自置信度(log概率)结合为M3P-Score，智能选择最有学习价值的偏好样本对，然后使用LoRA进行高效的直接偏好优化(DPO)微调。

Result: 在多个多模态指令跟随基准测试(MME-Bench、POPE、IFT、Human Pref. Score)上，M3PO consistently优于SFT、模拟RLHF、普通DPO和RM-DPO等强基线方法。

Conclusion: M3PO提供了一种数据高效的方法来增强LVLMs的视觉指令跟随能力，通过智能样本选择和综合质量评估机制，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold immense potential for complex
multimodal instruction following, yet their development is often hindered by
the high cost and inconsistency of human annotation required for effective
fine-tuning and preference alignment. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and existing preference optimization methods like RLHF and DPO frequently
struggle to efficiently leverage the model's own generation space to identify
highly informative "hard negative" samples. To address these challenges, we
propose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and
data-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual
instruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most "learning-valuable"
preference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This
selection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial
signals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the
model's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal
belief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically
identifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the
model might confidently generate despite being incorrect. These high-quality
preference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that M3PO consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including SFT, simulated RLHF, vanilla DPO, and RM-DPO, across a
comprehensive suite of multimodal instruction following benchmarks (MME-Bench,
POPE, IFT, Human Pref. Score).

diverse tasks: reading comprehension, open-domain QA, language inference,
causal reasoning, translation, and cultural QA. Our dataset covers 20
languages, with the addition of two formality registers for three languages. We
evaluate a diverse set of multilingual and region-focused LLMs and found that
this benchmark is challenging. We note a visible discrepancy between
performance in Indonesian and other languages, especially the low-resource
ones. There is no clear lead when using a region-specific model as opposed to
the general multilingual model. Lastly, we show that a change in register
affects model performance, especially with registers not commonly found in

Result: 20B模型在HumanEval和MMLU等多个基准上表现优于120B模型，整体性能处于中游水平，代码生成能力较强但多语言任务较弱

Conclusion: 稀疏架构的扩展不一定带来性能的线性提升，需要进一步研究优化策略，为未来开源部署提供更高效的模型选择指导

Abstract: In August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS models, its first open weight large
language models since GPT-2 in 2019, comprising two mixture of experts
architectures with 120B and 20B parameters. We evaluated both variants against
six contemporary open source large language models ranging from 14.7B to 235B
parameters, representing both dense and sparse designs, across ten benchmarks
covering general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, code generation,
multilingual understanding, and conversational ability. All models were tested
in unquantised form under standardised inference settings, with statistical
validation using McNemars test and effect size analysis. Results show that
gpt-oss-20B consistently outperforms gpt-oss-120B on several benchmarks, such
as HumanEval and MMLU, despite requiring substantially less memory and energy
per response. Both models demonstrate mid-tier overall performance within the
current open source landscape, with relative strength in code generation and
notable weaknesses in multilingual tasks. These findings provide empirical
evidence that scaling in sparse architectures may not yield proportional
performance gains, underscoring the need for further investigation into
optimisation strategies and informing more efficient model selection for future
open source deployments.

Motivation: 检验大型语言模型是否像人类儿童一样使用句法引导机制来学习动词含义，通过操纵学习环境来验证发展心理学假说

Method: 在句法信息被消除的扰动数据集上训练RoBERTa和GPT-2模型，比较句法线索和共现信息移除对模型表征的影响

Result: 模型动词表征在句法线索移除时退化更严重，心理动词受影响最大；名词表征则在共现信息扭曲时受影响更大

Conclusion: 研究证实了句法引导在动词学习中的重要作用，并展示了通过操纵大型语言模型学习环境来大规模测试发展假说的可行性

Abstract: Syntactic bootstrapping (Gleitman, 1990) is the hypothesis that children use
the syntactic environments in which a verb occurs to learn its meaning. In this
paper, we examine whether large language models exhibit a similar behavior. We
do this by training RoBERTa and GPT-2 on perturbed datasets where syntactic
information is ablated. Our results show that models' verb representation
degrades more when syntactic cues are removed than when co-occurrence
information is removed. Furthermore, the representation of mental verbs, for
which syntactic bootstrapping has been shown to be particularly crucial in
human verb learning, is more negatively impacted in such training regimes than
physical verbs. In contrast, models' representation of nouns is affected more
when co-occurrences are distorted than when syntax is distorted. In addition to
reinforcing the important role of syntactic bootstrapping in verb learning, our
results demonstrated the viability of testing developmental hypotheses on a
larger scale through manipulating the learning environments of large language
models.

such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic
token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between
variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or
satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning
framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed
acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a
dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an
input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated
answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves
the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on
CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces
the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that
explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical
inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at

*Seonglae Cho,Zekun Wu,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CorrSteer提出了一种基于相关性的稀疏自编码器特征选择方法，仅使用推理时激活就能自动提取相关特征，在多个任务上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器在下游控制任务中需要对比数据集或大量激活存储，限制了其有效性

Method: 通过关联样本正确性与推理时生成的SAE激活来选择特征，使用平均激活自动获取控制系数

Result: 在Gemma 2 2B和LLaMA 3.1 8B上，MMLU性能提升4.1%，HarmBench提升22.9%，仅需4000样本

Conclusion: 基于相关的特征选择是自动SAE控制的有效可扩展方法，揭示了驱动性能的底层能力

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large
language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in
downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive
datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose
CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE
activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only
inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding
spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average
activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task
performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning
benchmarks on Gemma 2 2B and LLaMA 3.1 8B, notably achieving a +4.1%
improvement in MMLU performance and a +22.9% improvement in HarmBench with only
4000 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns
aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities
that drive performance. Our work establishes correlationbased selection as an
effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language
model applications.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究多模态大语言模型在自动口语评估中的应用，提出Speech-First多模态训练方法，显著提升口语评估性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动口语评估系统存在模态限制：文本方法缺乏声学信息，音频方法缺失语义上下文。多模态大语言模型为同时处理音频和文本提供了新机会

Method: 提出Speech-First多模态训练(SFMT)，采用课程学习原则，先建立稳健的语音建模基础，再进行跨模态协同融合

Result: 在基准数据集上，MLLM系统将整体评估性能从PCC值0.783提升到0.846。SFMT在表达维度评估上取得4%的绝对准确率提升

Conclusion: MLLM为自动口语评估带来突破性进展，SFMT方法为表达维度评估开辟了新途径，展示了多模态融合在口语评估中的巨大潜力

Abstract: Traditional Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) systems exhibit inherent
modality limitations: text-based approaches lack acoustic information while
audio-based methods miss semantic context. Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) offer unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive ASA by
simultaneously processing audio and text within unified frameworks. This paper
presents a very first systematic study of MLLM for comprehensive ASA,
demonstrating the superior performance of MLLM across the aspects of content
and language use . However, assessment on the delivery aspect reveals unique
challenges, which is deemed to require specialized training strategies. We thus
propose Speech-First Multimodal Training (SFMT), leveraging a curriculum
learning principle to establish more robust modeling foundations of speech
before cross-modal synergetic fusion. A series of experiments on a benchmark
dataset show MLLM-based systems can elevate the holistic assessment performance
from a PCC value of 0.783 to 0.846. In particular, SFMT excels in the
evaluation of the delivery aspect, achieving an absolute accuracy improvement
of 4% over conventional training approaches, which also paves a new avenue for
ASA.

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Anchoring混合记忆架构，通过显式语言线索增强向量存储，在长期对话中比传统RAG基线提升18%的事实回忆和话语连贯性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长期多会话交互中受限于记忆持久性，传统RAG系统仅存储密集向量而忽略了句法依赖、话语关系和共指链接等精细语言结构

Method: 结合依赖解析、话语关系标注和共指消解创建结构化记忆条目，构建混合代理记忆架构

Result: 在适应后的长期对话数据集上，语义锚定相比强RAG基线在事实回忆和话语连贯性方面提升达18%

Conclusion: 显式语言线索的加入显著改善了长期对话中的记忆效果，证明了结构化语言信息对增强LLM记忆能力的重要性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and task
competence in conversational settings. However, their effectiveness in
multi-session and long-term interactions is hindered by limited memory
persistence. Typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems store
dialogue history as dense vectors, which capture semantic similarity but
neglect finer linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies, discourse
relations, and coreference links. We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid
agentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit
linguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our
approach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and
coreference resolution to create structured memory entries. Experiments on
adapted long-term dialogue datasets show that semantic anchoring improves
factual recall and discourse coherence by up to 18% over strong RAG baselines.
We further conduct ablation studies, human evaluations, and error analysis to
assess robustness and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在性能和效率之间的平衡挑战，GPT-5虽然引入了测试时路由，但需要更统一的解决方案来处理所有性能-效率权衡。

Method: 使用嵌入和聚类技术处理输入查询，然后基于性能-效率评分将每个查询路由到最合适的模型，集成多个不同容量和效率的LLM。

Result: 在6个基准测试和8个领先模型上取得最先进结果：比最强单模型(GPT-5-medium)准确率提升7%，以27%更低成本达到相同准确率，以63%更低成本达到90%性能，实现帕累托最优。

Conclusion: Avengers-Pro提供了一个统一的框架，能够在任何给定成本下获得最高准确率，或在任何给定准确率要求下实现最低成本，有效解决了LLM的性能-效率权衡问题。

Abstract: Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language
model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing,
dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model
during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing
framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing
a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro
embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable
model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks
and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and
Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a
performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single
model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the
average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach
~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a
Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost,
and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，假新闻生成变得容易，现有方法主要关注文本内容本身，但虚假痕迹往往难以发现，需要更可靠的检测方法

Method: 通过分布差异分析发现提示诱导的语言指纹，提出LIFE方法重构词级概率分布来寻找判别模式，并利用关键片段技术放大语言差异

Result: 实验显示LIFE在LLM生成假新闻检测上达到state-of-the-art性能，在人工撰写假新闻检测上也保持高性能

Conclusion: LIFE方法通过捕捉LLM生成真假新闻的概率分布差异，有效提升了假新闻检测的可靠性，为解决AI生成假新闻问题提供了新思路

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the generation of fake
news has become increasingly effortless, posing a growing societal threat and
underscoring the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Early efforts to
identify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual
content itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and
factually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to
uncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced
linguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between
LLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction
(LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find
discriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake
news. To further amplify these fingerprint patterns, we also leverage
key-fragment techniques that accentuate subtle linguistic differences, thereby
improving detection reliability. Our experiments show that LIFE achieves
state-of-the-art performance in LLM-generated fake news and maintains high
performance in human-written fake news. The code and data are available at

Motivation: LLM在低资源语言上的常识推理表现明显差于高资源语言，这种性能差异需要被消除以确保语言公平性。

Method: 使用受控语言混合方法生成合成代码转换文本，并基于此对LLM进行微调，创建了包含三种不同语言比例配置的CommonSenseQA代码转换数据集。

Result: 实验证明该方法显著提升了低资源语言的模型性能，同时保持或增强了高资源语言的性能。

Conclusion: 合成代码转换文本微调是解决LLM跨语言性能差异的有效方法，有助于实现语言公平性。

Abstract: Cutting-edge LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for multilingual
communication and understanding. However, LLMs perform worse in Common Sense
Reasoning (CSR) tasks when prompted in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Hindi
or Swahili compared to high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Equalizing
this inconsistent access to quality LLM outputs is crucial to ensure fairness
for speakers of LRLs and across diverse linguistic communities. In this paper,
we propose an approach to bridge this gap in LLM performance. Our approach
involves fine-tuning an LLM on synthetic code-switched text generated using
controlled language-mixing methods. We empirically demonstrate that fine-tuning
LLMs on synthetic code-switched datasets leads to substantial improvements in
LRL model performance while preserving or enhancing performance in HRLs.
Additionally, we present a new dataset of synthetic code-switched text derived
from the CommonSenseQA dataset, featuring three distinct language ratio
configurations.

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效预测人类感知的痛苦分数，游戏化评估框架为测试模型的情感推理和适应能力提供了新的方法，展示了在动态情感任务中的广泛应用前景

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
predicting human-perceived misery scores from natural language descriptions of
real-world scenarios. The task is framed as a regression problem, where the
model assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate
multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and
retrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches
consistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of
contextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation,
we introduce the "Misery Game Show", a novel gamified framework inspired by a
television format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal
comparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven
reasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but
also the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified
evaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional
reasoning tasks beyond standard regression. Code and data link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于模拟的数据生成方法依赖多个LLM代理之间的昂贵自回归交互，限制了代理任务在现实世界中的性能表现

Result: 实验证明ToolACE-MT能够实现高效、有效且可泛化的代理数据生成

Conclusion: 该方法为工具增强LLM场景中的高质量数据构建提供了新范式

Abstract: Agentic task-solving with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires multi-turn,
multi-step interactions, often involving complex function calls and dynamic
user-agent exchanges. Existing simulation-based data generation methods for
such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between
multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks.
In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation
framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic
dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three
stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline
verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet
semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase
introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill
operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and
coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that
ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data
generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in
tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理数据集缺乏学科广度和结构深度，无法有效激发强大的推理行为，需要创建更具挑战性和多样性的多学科推理数据集。

Method: 引入设计逻辑概念，模仿人类教育者的问题创建过程，使用LLMs从12万+现有问题中逆向工程设计逻辑，并将其与学科源材料匹配来生成推理问题。

Result: 创建了包含470万问题的两个数据集（DLR-Book 304万，DLR-Web 166万），覆盖75个学科。实验显示合成问题难度和多样性远超基线数据集，训练后的模型在多学科推理性能上超越了官方Qwen3模型。

Conclusion: DESIGNER方法能够有效生成高质量的多学科推理数据集，显著提升LLMs的复杂推理能力，为解决LLMs在多步骤跨学科推理方面的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural
language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning,
particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often
either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit
robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd
Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive
raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary
challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of
a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human
educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design
logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these
design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create
reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing
datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning
datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),
containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,
and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging
questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the
questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty
and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the
effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the
Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset
significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same
volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass
the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-4B models.

Conclusion: LinguaSafe基准强调了全面评估LLM多语言安全的重要性，为实现更平衡的安全对齐提供了关键工具，数据集和代码已公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The widespread adoption and increasing prominence of large language models
(LLMs) in global technologies necessitate a rigorous focus on ensuring their
safety across a diverse range of linguistic and cultural contexts. The lack of
a comprehensive evaluation and diverse data in existing multilingual safety
evaluations for LLMs limits their effectiveness, hindering the development of
robust multilingual safety alignment. To address this critical gap, we
introduce LinguaSafe, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark crafted
with meticulous attention to linguistic authenticity. The LinguaSafe dataset
comprises 45k entries in 12 languages, ranging from Hungarian to Malay. Curated
using a combination of translated, transcreated, and natively-sourced data, our
dataset addresses the critical need for multilingual safety evaluations of
LLMs, filling the void in the safety evaluation of LLMs across diverse
under-represented languages from Hungarian to Malay. LinguaSafe presents a
multidimensional and fine-grained evaluation framework, with direct and
indirect safety assessments, including further evaluations for oversensitivity.
The results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across
different domains and different languages, even in languages with similar
resource levels. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for
in-depth safety evaluation, underscoring the critical importance of thoroughly
assessing multilingual safety in LLMs to achieve more balanced safety

Motivation: 解决大规模数据库中自然语言问题与SQL查询之间的语义不匹配问题，特别是语义相似属性导致的模式链接困难和语义漂移问题。

Method: 提出CRED-SQL框架，包含两个核心组件：1）基于集群的大规模模式检索，精确定位相关表和列；2）引入执行描述语言（EDL）作为中间自然语言表示，将任务分解为Text-to-EDL和EDL-to-SQL两个阶段。

Result: 在两个大规模跨域基准测试SpiderUnion和BirdUnion上取得了新的最先进（SOTA）性能，验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CRED-SQL通过集群检索和EDL中间表示有效解决了大规模数据库中的语义不匹配问题，显著提升了Text-to-SQL系统的准确性，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems. However, a critical challenge remains: the
semantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their
corresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,
where semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift
during SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these
challenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale
databases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL
first performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the
tables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.
It then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution
Description Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This
reformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,
leveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic
deviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain
benchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and
scalability. Our code is available at https://github.com/smduan/CRED-SQL.git

Abstract: In this paper, we present the SALAMANDRATA family of models, an improved
iteration of SALAMANDRA LLMs (Gonzalez-Agirre et al., 2025) specifically
trained to achieve strong performance in translation-related tasks for 38
European languages. SALAMANDRATA comes in two scales: 2B and 7B parameters. For
both versions, we applied the same training recipe with a first step of
continual pre-training on parallel data, and a second step of supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality instructions. The BSC submission to the WMT25
General Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of
SALAMANDRATA. We first adapted the model vocabulary to support the additional
non-European languages included in the task. This was followed by a second
phase of continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, carefully designed
to optimize performance across all translation directions for this year's
shared task. For decoding, we employed two quality-aware strategies: Minimum
Bayes Risk Decoding and Tuned Re-ranking using COMET and COMET-KIWI
respectively. We publicly release both the 2B and 7B versions of SALAMANDRATA,
along with the newer SALAMANDRATA-V2 model, on Hugging Face1

Result: 在12个数据集和3种模态上的广泛实验表明，HeteroRAG在大多数医学视觉语言基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提升Med-LVLMs的事实准确性和可靠性

Conclusion: HeteroRAG框架通过有效整合异构知识源，成功解决了医疗大视觉语言模型的事实准确性问题，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的决策支持

Abstract: Medical large vision-language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promise in
clinical applications but suffer from factual inaccuracies and unreliable
outputs, posing risks in real-world diagnostics. While retrieval-augmented
generation has emerged as a potential solution, current medical multimodal RAG
systems are unable to perform effective retrieval across heterogeneous sources.
The irrelevance of retrieved reports affects the factuality of analysis, while
insufficient knowledge affects the credibility of clinical decision-making. To
bridge the gap, we construct MedAtlas, which includes extensive multimodal
report repositories and diverse text corpora. Based on it, we present
HeteroRAG, a novel framework that enhances Med-LVLMs through heterogeneous
knowledge sources. The framework introduces Modality-specific CLIPs for
effective report retrieval and a Multi-corpora Query Generator for dynamically
constructing queries for diverse corpora. Incorporating knowledge from such
multifaceted sources, Med-LVLM is then trained with Heterogeneous Knowledge
Preference Tuning to achieve cross-modality and multi-source knowledge
alignment. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 modalities
demonstrate that the proposed HeteroRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance
in most medical vision language benchmarks, significantly improving factual

TL;DR: 提出Atomic Thought思维范式和Atom-Searcher强化学习框架，通过细粒度推理单元和过程奖励解决传统RAG和RL方法在多跳推理和奖励稀疏性方面的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务中存在静态知识限制，传统检索增强生成方法在多跳推理和策略搜索方面表现不佳，基于结果的强化学习方法存在梯度冲突和奖励稀疏性问题

Method: 1. Atomic Thought：将推理分解为细粒度功能单元；2. Reasoning Reward Models提供原子思维奖励；3. Atom-Searcher框架：集成课程式奖励调度，早期优先过程奖励，后期转向结果奖励

Result: 在7个基准测试中均优于现有最先进方法，具有测试时计算可扩展性、更好的可解释性和更接近人类的推理模式

Conclusion: Atomic Thought和Atom-Searcher框架有效解决了多跳推理和奖励稀疏性问题，提供了更高效、可解释的深度研究代理解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities,
but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information,
yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid
workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to
autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current
approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical
issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance
gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic
Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into
fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward
Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained
guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for
agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher
uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR
early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on
effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent
improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1)
Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides
supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3)
Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了高资源标准语言对齐有助于低资源变体建模的假设，通过因果研究发现过度依赖现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)反而阻碍阿拉伯方言的生成建模，并提出在线变分探测框架进行解耦干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统假设，证明高资源标准语言的过度表征纠缠会阻碍相关低资源变体的生成建模能力，特别是在阿拉伯方言与MSA的关系中。

Method: 提出在线变分探测框架，在微调过程中持续估计标准变体的子空间，实现基于投影的解耦干预，使用阿拉伯语25种方言作为案例研究。

Result: 在25种方言上，干预使生成质量平均提升+2.0 chrF++，最高提升+4.9 chrF++，尽管标准语言性能有所下降。

Conclusion: 提供了因果证据表明高资源变体的子空间主导会限制相关变体的生成能力，为多语言和多领域LLMs的表征分配控制提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the
modeling of related low-resource varieties. We challenge this assumption by
demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant
variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects,
can actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive
causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the
internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key
contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously
estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling
projection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a
case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the
broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy
for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.
Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9
chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured
tradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal
evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict
generative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric
and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions,
offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related
language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational
allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released.

Abstract: We present our work to build a French semantic corpus by annotating French
dialogue in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Specifically, we annotate
the DinG corpus, consisting of transcripts of spontaneous French dialogues
recorded during the board game Catan. As AMR has insufficient coverage of the
dynamics of spontaneous speech, we extend the framework to better represent
spontaneous speech and sentence structures specific to French. Additionally, to
support consistent annotation, we provide an annotation guideline detailing
these extensions. We publish our corpus under a free license (CC-SA-BY). We
also train and evaluate an AMR parser on our data. This model can be used as an
assistance annotation tool to provide initial annotations that can be refined
by human annotators. Our work contributes to the development of semantic
resources for French dialogue.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了利用上下文信息（父推文）来提升回复推文中辱骂性语言检测的效果，发现内容特征比账户特征更重要，且多种特征组合效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的辱骂性语言检测研究主要关注单个社交媒体帖子，忽略了对话上下文信息。本研究旨在探索利用父推文上下文是否能帮助检测回复中的辱骂内容。

Method: 使用四种分类模型，在包含父推文-回复推文对的对话数据集上测试了基于内容和账户的特征，比较了仅使用回复特征与结合上下文特征的效果。

Result: 结合上下文特征相比仅使用回复特征有显著提升，内容特征比账户特征贡献更大，多种特征组合效果优于选择性使用少量特征。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对辱骂性语言检测至关重要，内容特征比用户身份特征更有效，开发上下文感知的检测模型能提升现实对话场景中的检测性能。

Abstract: Abusive language detection has become an increasingly important task as a
means to tackle this type of harmful content in social media. There has been a
substantial body of research developing models for determining if a social
media post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on
exploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that
can be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational
exchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent
tweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if
a reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the
most? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from
the context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only
looking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,
we test four different classification models on a dataset made of
conversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as
abusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features
leads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from
the reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We
observe that, among the features under study, it is especially the
content-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the
classification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting
it). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of
different features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and
using fewer features. Our study provides insights into the development of
contextualized abusive language detection models in realistic settings
involving conversations.

Motivation: 虽然间接证据表明早期经院哲学时期基于口头教学记录（reportationes）的文学创作很常见，但很少有资料评论这种实践。需要验证关于这些文集形成过程的假设

Method: 采用HTR（手写文本识别）流程和文体计量分析，基于高频词、词性标签和伪词缀，比较手动编写和自动提取数据的性能，测试基于transformer的OCR和自动转录对齐的有效性

Result: 研究尚未完成，但预期将提供一个可重复使用的模板，用于分析中世纪大学产生的协作文学创作

Conclusion: 如果成功，这项研究将为探索性分析中世纪大学协作文学创作提供一个易于重复使用的模板，对经院哲学传统的计算研究具有方法论意义

Abstract: While the indirect evidence suggests that already in the early scholastic
period the literary production based on records of oral teaching (so-called
reportationes) was not uncommon, there are very few sources commenting on the
practice. This paper details the design of a study applying stylometric
techniques of authorship attribution to a collection developed from
reportationes -- Stephen Langton's Quaestiones Theologiae -- aiming to uncover
layers of editorial work and thus validate some hypotheses regarding the
collection's formation. Following Camps, Cl\'erice, and Pinche (2021), I
discuss the implementation of an HTR pipeline and stylometric analysis based on
the most frequent words, POS tags, and pseudo-affixes. The proposed study will
offer two methodological gains relevant to computational research on the
scholastic tradition: it will directly compare performance on manually composed
and automatically extracted data, and it will test the validity of
transformer-based OCR and automated transcription alignment for workflows
applied to scholastic Latin corpora. If successful, this study will provide an
easily reusable template for the exploratory analysis of collaborative literary
production stemming from medieval universities.

Motivation: 探究Transformer语言模型是否具有类似人类词汇存储的语义表征机制，验证模型如何处理语义信息

Method: 提取RoBERTa-base模型的词嵌入空间，使用k-means聚类为200个簇，手动检查簇的语义敏感性，并测试对五个心理语言学指标的敏感性

Result: 词嵌入空间编码了广泛的语义信息，簇对语义信息敏感，支持模型具有语义处理能力

Conclusion: 研究结果反驳了Transformer模型处理语义信息的"意义消除主义"假说，证实模型确实编码了丰富的语义表征

Abstract: We investigate how word meanings are represented in the transformer language
models. Specifically, we focus on whether transformer models employ something
analogous to a lexical store - where each word has an entry that contains
semantic information. To do this, we extracted the token embedding space of
RoBERTa-base and k-means clustered it into 200 clusters. In our first study, we
then manually inspected the resultant clusters to consider whether they are
sensitive to semantic information. In our second study, we tested whether the
clusters are sensitive to five psycholinguistic measures: valence,
concreteness, iconicity, taboo, and age of acquisition. Overall, our findings
were very positive - there is a wide variety of semantic information encoded
within the token embedding space. This serves to rule out certain "meaning
eliminativist" hypotheses about how transformer LLMs process semantic
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂表格存在语义丢失、本体层次要求严格、同义词、拼写错误和缩写等问题，导致现有语义表格标注方法准确率受限。

Method: 基于ReAct框架设计五个外部工具，使用LLM智能体动态选择适合的标注策略，并利用Levenshtein距离减少冗余标注。

Result: 在SemTab挑战的Tough Tables和BiodivTab数据集上超越现有方法，时间成本降低70%，LLM token使用减少60%。

Conclusion: 该方法为语义表格标注提供了高效且成本效益高的解决方案，能够有效处理复杂表格的各种挑战。

Abstract: The Semantic Table Annotation (STA) task, which includes Column Type
Annotation (CTA) and Cell Entity Annotation (CEA), maps table contents to
ontology entities and plays important roles in various semantic applications.
However, complex tables often pose challenges such as semantic loss of column
names or cell values, strict ontological hierarchy requirements, homonyms,
spelling errors, and abbreviations, which hinder annotation accuracy. To
address these issues, this paper proposes an LLM-based agent approach for CTA
and CEA. We design and implement five external tools with tailored prompts
based on the ReAct framework, enabling the STA agent to dynamically select
suitable annotation strategies depending on table characteristics. Experiments
are conducted on the Tough Tables and BiodivTab datasets from the SemTab
challenge, which contain the aforementioned challenges. Our method outperforms
existing approaches across various metrics. Furthermore, by leveraging
Levenshtein distance to reduce redundant annotations, we achieve a 70%
reduction in time costs and a 60% reduction in LLM token usage, providing an
efficient and cost-effective solution for STA.

Motivation: 现有自优化方法采用固定迭代次数的反应式流程，难以根据生成上下文动态确定最佳优化时机和内容，需要更接近人类思考方式的动态优化方法

Method: 提出ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR)方法，基于模型内部状态和演化上下文主动决定是否优化、何时优化以及如何优化，而不是重新生成整个响应

Result: 在10个多样化任务上的实验表明，PASR显著提升问题解决性能。在Qwen3-8B上，相比标准生成平均减少41.6%的token消耗，同时准确率提升8.2%

Conclusion: PASR通过主动动态优化机制，在提高模型性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为大语言模型的自我优化提供了更高效的新方法

Abstract: Recent advances in self-refinement have demonstrated significant potential
for improving the outputs of large language models (LLMs) through iterative
refinement. However, most existing self-refinement methods rely on a reactive
process with a fixed number of iterations, making it difficult to determine the
optimal timing and content of refinement based on the evolving generation
context. Inspired by the way humans dynamically refine their thoughts during
execution, we propose ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR), a novel method that
enables LLMs to refine their outputs during the generation process. Unlike
methods that regenerate entire responses, PASR proactively decides whether,
when, and how to refine based on the model's internal state and evolving
context. We conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of 10 tasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of PASR. Experimental results show that PASR
significantly enhances problem-solving performance. In particular, on Qwen3-8B,
PASR reduces average token consumption by 41.6 percent compared to standard
generation, while also achieving an 8.2 percent improvement in accuracy. Our
code and all baselines used in the paper are available in the GitHub.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在长时域、多约束规划任务中面临信息细节处理和复杂约束满足的挑战，需要更好的信息共享和协调机制。

Method: 构建基于LLM的多智能体系统进行旅行规划，评估笔记本机制促进信息共享的效果，以及协调器智能体在自由对话中的协调作用。

Result: 笔记本机制减少幻觉错误18%，协调器进一步减少错误13.5%。组合机制在TravelPlanner基准测试中达到25%通过率，比单智能体基线7.5%提升17.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化信息共享和反射式协调是多智能体系统处理长时域规划任务的关键组件，具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have pushed the boundaries of large language model
(LLM) agents in domains such as web research and software engineering. However,
long-horizon, multi-constraint planning tasks involve conditioning on detailed
information and satisfying complex interdependent constraints, which can pose a
challenge for these systems. In this study, we construct an LLM-based MAS for a
travel planning task which is representative of these challenges. We evaluate
the impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an
orchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between
agents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by
18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce
errors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms
achieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute
improvement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results
highlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective
orchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks,
such as finding offers for specific products in multiple online shops and
subsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. This
paper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating
the effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall
consists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers
sourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These
tasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,
performing price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing
checkout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague
requirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible
products. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or
ShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple
shops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they
originate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall
require longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining
representative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline
agents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and
underlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The
best-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合反馈损失和两阶段微调，有效解决了讽刺语音合成的挑战，为生成更具表现力的讽刺语音提供了可行方案

Abstract: Sarcastic speech synthesis, which involves generating speech that effectively
conveys sarcasm, is essential for enhancing natural interactions in
applications such as entertainment and human-computer interaction. However,
synthesizing sarcastic speech remains a challenge due to the nuanced prosody
that characterizes sarcasm, as well as the limited availability of annotated
sarcastic speech data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a
novel approach that integrates feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection
model into the TTS training process, enhancing the model's ability to capture
and convey sarcasm. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech
synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning
process. First, it is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing various
speech styles, including sarcastic speech. In the second stage, the model is
further refined using a dataset focused specifically on sarcastic speech,
enhancing its ability to generate sarcasm-aware speech. Objective and
subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the
quality, naturalness, and sarcasm-awareness of synthesized speech.

Conclusion: LoRID通过模仿人类双系统思维模式，有效提升了小语言模型的数学推理能力，证明了多LoRA交互蒸馏方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have
strong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of
parameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models
(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of
data for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,
which resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.
However, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is
first acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two
distinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA
Interaction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input
the question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create
knowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student
model as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts
for problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge
Generator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only
knowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to
perform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR
and DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference
process needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical
reasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show
that LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K
dataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,
12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.

a novel evaluation framework addressing tokenization challenges specific to
morphologically-rich and low-resource languages such as Turkish. Utilizing the
Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) dataset, comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions from
the Turkish education system, we assessed tokenizers based on vocabulary size,
token count, processing time, language-specific token percentages (\%TR), and
token purity (\%Pure). These newly proposed metrics measure how effectively
tokenizers preserve linguistic structures. Our analysis reveals that
language-specific token percentages exhibit a stronger correlation with
downstream performance (e.g., MMLU scores) than token purity. Furthermore,
increasing model parameters alone does not necessarily enhance linguistic
performance, underscoring the importance of tailored, language-specific
tokenization methods. The proposed framework establishes robust and practical
tokenization standards for morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: SFUSED语音错误数据库可用于评估语音识别模型性能，通过分析WhisperX在5300个语音错误上的转录准确率，验证了该数据库作为ASR系统诊断工具的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个系统标注的语音错误数据库，用于测试和评估语音识别模型在真实语音错误场景下的表现。

Method: 使用SFUSED数据库中的5300个标注语音错误（包括单词和音位错误），评估WhisperX模型的转录准确率，分析不同分类维度对模型性能的影响。

Result: 分析表明SFUSED数据库能够有效诊断ASR系统的性能，展示了不同分类变量（如语言层级、上下文敏感性等）对模型评估的价值。

Conclusion: SFUSED语音错误数据库是一个有效的诊断工具，可用于全面评估语音识别模型在处理真实语音错误时的性能表现。

Abstract: The Simon Fraser University Speech Error Database (SFUSED) is a public data
collection developed for linguistic and psycholinguistic research. Here we
demonstrate how its design and annotations can be used to test and evaluate
speech recognition models. The database comprises systematically annotated
speech errors from spontaneous English speech, with each error tagged for
intended and actual error productions. The annotation schema incorporates
multiple classificatory dimensions that are of some value to model assessment,
including linguistic hierarchical level, contextual sensitivity, degraded
words, word corrections, and both word-level and syllable-level error
positioning. To assess the value of these classificatory variables, we
evaluated the transcription accuracy of WhisperX across 5,300 documented word
and phonological errors. This analysis demonstrates the atabase's effectiveness
as a diagnostic tool for ASR system performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ReCOR强化学习框架，通过自适应选择token生成顺序来改进因果和扩散语言模型，在推理和规划任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前因果和扩散模型使用固定或随机token生成顺序，与原始逻辑顺序不符，在处理需要自适应生成顺序的问题时存在困难

Method: 基于强化学习的ReCOR框架，通过token预测统计进行自监督，估计未填充token的预测难度并自适应选择下一个token

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理和规划数据集上，ReCOR表现优于基线模型，有时甚至超过使用真实顺序监督的oracle模型

Conclusion: 自适应token生成顺序对语言模型性能有显著提升，ReCOR框架能有效提取数据依赖的生成顺序而不需要标注

Abstract: Modern causal language models, followed by rapid developments in discrete
diffusion models, can now produce a wide variety of interesting and useful
content. However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output
tokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the
logical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we
observe that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in
problems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably,
which we characterize with the $\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated
by this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a
reinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent
token generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by
token prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every
unfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and
inference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines,
sometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHPLT是当前最大的公开文档级机器翻译数据集，包含1.24亿个文档对，覆盖50种语言与英语的配对，总计42.6亿个句子，为长上下文建模和文档级翻译提供重要基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译资源仅覆盖少数高资源语言，无法满足全球社区对文档级翻译和长上下文建模的需求，需要创建大规模多语言数据集来促进相关研究和应用。

Method: 修改现有的网页提取流程，从源头保持完整的文档完整性（包括未对齐部分），而不是基于句子级数据重建文档。通过初步实验确定最优训练上下文策略。

Result: 在DocHPLT上微调的大型语言模型显著优于现成的指令调优基线模型，特别是对低资源语言表现出特别显著的改进效果。

Conclusion: DocHPLT数据集为推进多语言文档级翻译提供了必要的基础设施，通过开源许可发布，将促进全球社区在文档级翻译和长上下文建模方面的发展。

Abstract: Existing document-level machine translation resources are only available for
a handful of languages, mostly high-resourced ones. To facilitate the training
and evaluation of document-level translation and, more broadly, long-context
modeling for global communities, we create DocHPLT, the largest publicly
available document-level translation dataset to date. It contains 124 million
aligned document pairs across 50 languages paired with English, comprising 4.26
billion sentences, with further possibility to provide 2500 bonus pairs not
involving English. Unlike previous reconstruction-based approaches that piece
together documents from sentence-level data, we modify an existing web
extraction pipeline to preserve complete document integrity from the source,
retaining all content including unaligned portions. After our preliminary
experiments identify the optimal training context strategy for document-level
translation, we demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on DocHPLT substantially
outperform off-the-shelf instruction-tuned baselines, with particularly
dramatic improvements for under-resourced languages. We open-source the dataset
under a permissive license, providing essential infrastructure for advancing
multilingual document-level translation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个端到端的法律领域RAG管道，通过上下文感知查询翻译、开源检索策略和综合评估框架三大增强，显著提升了检索性能和法律回答的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在法律领域中，检索增强生成(RAG)通过引用来源来减少大语言模型的幻觉问题至关重要。现有基线方法需要进一步优化以提供更准确、可靠的法律研究辅助。

Method: 1) 上下文感知查询翻译器，分离文档引用和自然语言问题，根据专业性和特异性调整检索深度和响应风格；2) 使用SBERT和GTE嵌入的开源检索策略；3) 结合RAGAS、BERTScore-F1和ROUGE-Recall的综合评估框架

Result: 检索性能显著提升：Recall@K提高30-95%，Precision@K提高约2.5倍(K>4)；开源管道在检索质量上媲美或超越专有方法；定制法律提示产生更忠实和上下文相关的答案

Conclusion: 通过任务感知的组件级调优，可以构建法律基础扎实、可复现且成本效益高的RAG系统，为法律研究辅助提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations by grounding
large language model outputs in cited sources, a capability that is especially
critical in the legal domain. We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that
revisits and extends the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted
enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document
references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and
response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval
strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance
gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95\% and Precision@K by $\sim$2.5$\times$ for
$K>4$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and
generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to
assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs.
Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or
outperform proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom
legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually
relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions
demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver
legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal
research assistance.

TL;DR: AutoBnB-RAG框架通过检索增强生成技术扩展了AutoBnB，在网络安全事件响应模拟中让多智能体能够查询外部知识，显著提升了决策质量和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在事件响应模拟中缺乏外部知识访问能力，限制了其推理效果，需要引入检索机制来增强决策能力。

Method: 基于Backdoors & Breaches桌面游戏环境，构建了AutoBnB-RAG框架，引入两种检索设置：技术文档检索(RAG-Wiki)和事件报告检索(RAG-News)，并评估了八种团队结构。

Result: 检索增强显著提高了决策质量和成功率，能够重建复杂的多阶段网络攻击，在不同组织模型中均表现良好。

Conclusion: 将检索机制集成到基于LLM的多智能体系统中对网络安全决策具有重要价值，提升了事件响应的效果和实用性。

Abstract: Incident response (IR) requires fast, coordinated, and well-informed
decision-making to contain and mitigate cyber threats. While large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings,
their reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In
this work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that
incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident
response simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game
environment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and
incorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce
two retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation
(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We
evaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced
argumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To
validate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based
on public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct
complex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation
improves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational
models. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms
into LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BlindSpot框架来检测和量化LLM在客服通话摘要中的操作偏见，发现所有模型都存在系统性偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在客服中心生成大量通话摘要，但现有研究未关注操作偏见（如口吃、说话者、话题等维度），需要系统评估偏见问题

Method: 开发BlindSpot框架，基于15个操作偏见维度的分类法，使用LLM作为零样本分类器计算转录和摘要的分布差异，采用Fidelity Gap和Coverage两个指标量化偏见

Result: 对2500个真实通话转录和20个不同规模LLM生成的摘要进行分析，发现所有模型无论大小或家族都存在系统性偏见

Conclusion: 操作偏见在LLM生成的客服通话摘要中普遍存在，需要开发偏见缓解技术来确保摘要的公平性和准确性

Abstract: Abstractive summarization is a core application in contact centers, where
Large Language Models (LLMs) generate millions of summaries of call transcripts
daily. Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs
systematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript,
potentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has
examined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to
contact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon
a taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)
for the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages
an LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each
bias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then
quantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between
distributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using
BlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and
their summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,
Llama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present
across all evaluated models, regardless of size or family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语常识验证任务研究不足的问题，特别是地区方言在现有资源中代表性不足，尽管方言在口语环境中普遍使用。

Method: 引入MuDRiC多方言阿拉伯语常识数据集，并采用图卷积网络(GCNs)进行阿拉伯语常识推理，增强语义关系建模以提高常识验证能力。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在阿拉伯语常识验证任务上实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过提供基础数据集和新颖方法，该工作提升了阿拉伯语自然语言理解能力，特别是处理其复杂语言变体的能力。

Abstract: Commonsense validation evaluates whether a sentence aligns with everyday
human understanding, a critical capability for developing robust natural
language understanding systems. While substantial progress has been made in
English, the task remains underexplored in Arabic, particularly given its rich
linguistic diversity. Existing Arabic resources have primarily focused on
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), leaving regional dialects underrepresented
despite their prevalence in spoken contexts. To bridge this gap, we present two
key contributions: (i) we introduce MuDRiC, an extended Arabic commonsense
dataset incorporating multiple dialects, and (ii) a novel method adapting Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to Arabic commonsense reasoning, which enhances
semantic relationship modeling for improved commonsense validation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior
performance in Arabic commonsense validation. Our work enhances Arabic natural
language understanding by providing both a foundational dataset and a novel
method for handling its complex variations. To the best of our knowledge, we
release the first Arabic multi-dialect commonsense reasoning dataset.

TL;DR: 本文研究结合水印检测器与非水印检测器的方法，在语言模型生成检测中取得比单独使用任一类检测器更好的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印检测在语言模型生成检测中效果显著，但其强度严重依赖模型熵值，而经过指令微调或RLHF等后训练的模型熵值有限，使得仅靠水印检测面临挑战

Method: 探索多种混合方案，将水印检测器与非水印检测器相结合，在广泛的实验条件下进行测试

Result: 观察到混合方案在各种实验条件下都取得了比单独使用任一类检测器更好的性能提升

Conclusion: 结合水印和非水印检测器的混合策略能够有效提高语言模型生成检测的准确性，特别是在熵值受限的后训练模型场景中

Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the
generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark
typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and
the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice,
especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning
or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection
based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether
detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark
ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing
performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of
experimental conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OptimalThinkingBench基准测试，用于评估LLM的过度思考（overthinking）和思考不足（underthinking）问题，发现现有模型无法在性能和效率间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在处理复杂任务时需要大量计算（过度思考），而在简单问题上又思考不足，导致用户需要手动选择不同模型。需要统一的评估标准来推动开发平衡性能与效率的优化思考模型。

Method: 创建包含两个子基准的测试集：OverthinkingBench（72个领域的简单查询）和UnderthinkingBench（11个复杂推理任务），使用思维调整准确率指标评估33个不同模型。

Result: 没有模型能在基准测试中实现最优思考。思考模型在简单查询上过度思考数百个token却无性能提升，大型非思考模型则思考不足，表现不如更小的思考模型。各种优化方法往往只能改善一个子基准而牺牲另一个。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的统一模型来实现最优思考，平衡LLM的性能和计算效率，当前方法尚无法同时解决过度思考和思考不足的问题。

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and
overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and
cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the
development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the
onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this
work, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly
evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the
development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and
efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,
featuring simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11
challenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we
perform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models
and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking
models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries
without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models
underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further
explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these
approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,
highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发大型语言模型成本高昂，需要基于小规模实验做出决策，但现有评估基准的质量参差不齐，缺乏可靠的评估标准来指导模型开发决策。

Method: 引入信号（区分模型好坏的能力）和噪声（对训练随机变化的敏感性）两个关键指标，提出三个干预措施：使用更好的度量指标（如困惑度而非准确率）、过滤噪声子任务、平均模型中间检查点输出。

Result: 信号噪声比更好的基准在小规模决策中更可靠，噪声较低的基准具有更低的缩放定律预测误差。提出的干预措施都能有效提高评估可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议创建新基准或选择现有基准时应追求高信号和低噪声，使用更好的度量指标、过滤噪声任务和平均检查点输出可以有效提高评估质量。

Abstract: Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions
with small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation
suites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark
more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality
evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in
current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models
from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability
between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better
signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,
and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These
results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful
benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect
signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has
better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better
reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy
subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable
multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's
intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We
conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which
existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30
benchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M
to 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K
evaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.

Conclusion: LLM内部表示确实包含更有效的区分特征，RepreGuard方法在检测LLM生成文本方面表现出色，特别是在分布外场景下具有优越的鲁棒性

Abstract: Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing
detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to
features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of
LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively
capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between
LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this
hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural
activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we
propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.
Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of
LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better
identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of
the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a
precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms
all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD
scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and
mainstream attacks. Data and code are publicly available at:

Method: 使用程序化数据训练表征模型，构建显式的参考图像嵌入数据库（视觉记忆），在推理时通过检索记忆库来完成各种视觉任务

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：NIGHTS视觉相似性仅差1%，CUB200和Flowers102细粒度分类分别超越8%和15%，ImageNet-1K分类差距在10%以内，COCO零样本分割R²差距在10%内

Abstract: We train representation models with procedural data only, and apply them on
visual similarity, classification, and semantic segmentation tasks without
further training by using visual memory -- an explicit database of reference
image embeddings. Unlike prior work on visual memory, our approach achieves
full compartmentalization with respect to all real-world images while retaining
strong performance. Compared to a model trained on Places, our procedural model
performs within $1\%$ on NIGHTS visual similarity, outperforms by $8\%$ and
$15\%$ on CUB200 and Flowers102 fine-grained classification, and is within
$10\%$ on ImageNet-1K classification. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot
segmentation, achieving an $R^2$ on COCO within $10\%$ of the models trained on
real data. Finally, we analyze procedural versus real data models, showing that
parts of the same object have dissimilar representations in procedural models,
resulting in incorrect searches in memory and explaining the remaining

Result: DINORET和RetiZero在眼科和全身性疾病任务中表现最优，RetiZero在外部队据集上泛化能力更强。门控融合方法在青光眼、AMD和高血压预测中带来适度改进，但预测全身性疾病（特别是外部队列的高血压）仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了基于证据的眼科基础模型评估，证明了模型融合的益处，并为增强临床适用性指明了策略方向，但全身性疾病预测仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown great promise in medical image analysis by
improving generalization across diverse downstream tasks. In ophthalmology,
several FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to
fundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across
different tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is
the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic
FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive
evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different
ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection
(glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and
systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal
imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM,
RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and
evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that
DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and
systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on
external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach
provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.
Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension
in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an
evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model
fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability.

TL;DR: UniDCF是一个统一的多模态深度学习框架，能够通过点云和多视角图像的融合编码来重建多种牙颌面硬组织，解决了现有单模态方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙颌面硬组织缺损严重影响患者生理功能、面部美观和心理健康，现有深度学习模型局限于单组织和单模态输入，导致泛化性差，需要在解剖保真度、计算效率和跨组织适应性之间做出权衡。

Method: 提出UniDCF框架，通过点云和多视角图像的多模态融合编码，利用各模态的互补优势，并加入基于分数的去噪模块来优化表面平滑度。构建了包含6,609名患者的口内扫描、CBCT和CT数据的大型多模态数据集。

Result: 评估显示UniDCF在几何精度、结构完整性和空间准确性方面优于现有最先进方法。临床模拟表明重建设计时间减少99%，临床医生接受度超过94%。

Conclusion: UniDCF实现了快速、自动化、高保真度的重建，支持个性化和精确的修复治疗，简化临床工作流程，改善患者治疗效果。

Abstract: Dentocraniofacial hard tissue defects profoundly affect patients'
physiological functions, facial aesthetics, and psychological well-being,
posing significant challenges for precise reconstruction. Current deep learning
models are limited to single-tissue scenarios and modality-specific imaging
inputs, resulting in poor generalizability and trade-offs between anatomical
fidelity, computational efficiency, and cross-tissue adaptability. Here we
introduce UniDCF, a unified framework capable of reconstructing multiple
dentocraniofacial hard tissues through multimodal fusion encoding of point
clouds and multi-view images. By leveraging the complementary strengths of each
modality and incorporating a score-based denoising module to refine surface
smoothness, UniDCF overcomes the limitations of prior single-modality
approaches. We curated the largest multimodal dataset, comprising intraoral
scans, CBCT, and CT from 6,609 patients, resulting in 54,555 annotated
instances. Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural
completeness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF
reduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated
acceptability exceeding 94%. Overall, UniDCF enables rapid, automated, and
high-fidelity reconstruction, supporting personalized and precise restorative
treatments, streamlining clinical workflows, and enhancing patient outcomes.

TL;DR: Ovis2.5是Ovis2的升级版，具备原生分辨率视觉感知和强大多模态推理能力，在OpenCompass排行榜上取得SOTA成绩


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决固定分辨率处理导致的细节损失问题，并增强多模态推理能力，特别是对于复杂图表等视觉密集内容

Method: 采用原生分辨率视觉Transformer处理可变分辨率图像，引入反思机制（自检查和修订），通过五阶段课程训练（视觉预训练、指令微调、DPO和GRPO对齐），使用多模态数据打包和混合并行技术

Result: Ovis2.5-9B平均得分78.3，Ovis2.5-2B得分73.9，在STEM基准测试、接地任务和视频任务上表现领先，在复杂图表分析方面达到开源SOTA

Conclusion: Ovis2.5在保持小模型高性能的同时，通过原生分辨率处理和反思推理机制，显著提升了多模态理解和推理能力，为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution
visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a
native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,
variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and
preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense
content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to
move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including
self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional
"thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced
accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive
five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins
with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through
large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning
enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ
multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant
end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and
Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy
of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the
OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a
substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter
range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate
scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong
capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its
scale for complex chart analysis.

Motivation: 解决现有AVE数据集仅支持文本到文本或图像到文本设置，缺乏对产品视频支持、多样化属性覆盖和公开可用性的问题。

Method: 提出基于CLIP的专家混合过滤系统(CLIP-MoE)来移除不匹配的视频-产品对，确保数据质量。

Result: 视频到文本AVE仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，特别是在开放设置中，现有视频视觉语言模型在利用有效时间信息方面还有改进空间。

Conclusion: VideoAVE为视频属性值提取提供了首个公开数据集和基准，推动了更先进视频视觉语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is important for structuring product
information in e-commerce. However, existing AVE datasets are primarily limited
to text-to-text or image-to-text settings, lacking support for product videos,
diverse attribute coverage, and public availability. To address these gaps, we
introduce VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text e-commerce AVE
dataset across 14 different domains and covering 172 unique attributes. To
ensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts
filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs,
resulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data.
In order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a
comprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision
language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and
open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that
video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings,
and there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging
effective temporal information. The dataset and benchmark code for VideoAVE are

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar
curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient
on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten

demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with

Motivation: 现代网络充斥着多模态内容，仇恨表情包检测面临挑战，因为有害意图往往通过文本和图像的微妙互动以幽默或讽刺形式呈现。现有视觉语言模型缺乏细粒度监督支持，容易受到隐式仇恨言论影响。

Method: 1) 提出提示优化框架，系统变化提示结构、监督粒度和训练模态；2) 引入多模态数据增强管道，通过多智能体LLM-VLM设置生成2479个反事实中性表情包，隔离并重写仇恨模态。

Result: 结构化提示即使在小模型中也能提高鲁棒性，InternVL2在二元和缩放设置中均获得最佳F1分数。数据增强管道成功减少虚假相关性，提高分类器泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提示结构和数据组成与模型规模同等重要，针对性增强可以支持更可信和上下文敏感的仇恨检测，为构建合成数据训练鲁棒公平的视觉语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the
challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed
through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or
satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise,
these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible
to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to
improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization
framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity,
and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both
influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in
small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and
scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline
that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting
the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup,
successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier
generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic
data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate
that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and
that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive
hate detection.

Method: 研究高斯曲率在3D表面建模中的角色，使用Middlebury立体数据集进行验证，分析其作为不变量的特性和实际应用价值。

Result: 发现高斯曲率提供稀疏紧凑的3D表面描述；现有单目和立体方法似乎隐式考虑高斯曲率；可作为几何先验改进3D重建；可能作为立体方法的无监督评估指标。

Conclusion: 高斯曲率在3D表面建模中具有重要作用，为计算机视觉提供了可分析、可迁移的显式几何模型，有望推动更可控和可解释的3D重建方法发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have predominantly relied on data-driven
approaches that leverage deep learning and large-scale datasets. Deep neural
networks have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as stereo matching and
monocular depth reconstruction. However, these methods lack explicit models of
3D geometry that can be directly analyzed, transferred across modalities, or
systematically modified for controlled experimentation. We investigate the role
of Gaussian curvature in 3D surface modeling. Besides Gaussian curvature being
an invariant quantity under change of observers or coordinate systems, we
demonstrate using the Middlebury stereo dataset that it offers: (i) a sparse
and compact description of 3D surfaces, (ii) state-of-the-art monocular and
stereo methods seem to implicitly consider it, but no explicit module of such
use can be extracted, (iii) a form of geometric prior that can inform and
improve 3D surface reconstruction, and (iv) a possible use as an unsupervised
metric for stereo methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived
graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or
anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting
features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness
of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for
GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we
systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge
construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and
shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to
perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on
dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance
and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised
regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute
the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features
consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised
configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805
without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches.
With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to
0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks
for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary
tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that
exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage
- colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial
content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and
without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive
experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a
variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and
transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and
synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on
downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for
applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic
systems.

TL;DR: 医学影像基础模型在标签效率方面表现优异，但图像质量分布及其在微调与测试集之间的不匹配会显著影响模型性能。研究发现高质量图像在微调集中的充足性对维持强性能至关重要，而质量分布一致性在不同下游任务中的重要性各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估医学影像基础模型在标签效率方面的表现，特别是在前列腺多参数MRI中，研究图像质量变化如何影响标签高效的微调过程，并测量微调模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用ProFound（一个在大型前列腺MRI数据集上预训练的领域特定视觉基础模型），通过系统变化微调和评估集中的高/低质量图像比例来进行实验，分析图像质量分布对模型性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现：a) 微调集和测试集之间高/低质量图像比例的变化会导致下游性能显著差异；b) 微调集中足够高质量图像的存在对维持强性能至关重要；c) 当质量比例一致时，微调需要的标注数据远少于从头训练，但标签效率取决于图像质量分布。

Conclusion: 图像质量分布及其在微调与部署之间的对齐对基础模型的性能至关重要。缺乏足够高质量微调数据时，预训练模型可能无法超越无预训练的模型。这强调了在微调和部署中评估和对齐质量分布的重要性，以及为特定下游任务制定微调数据质量标准的必要性。

Abstract: Foundation models in medical imaging have shown promising label efficiency,
achieving high downstream performance with only a fraction of annotated data.
Here, we evaluate this in prostate multiparametric MRI using ProFound, a
domain-specific vision foundation model pretrained on large-scale prostate MRI
datasets. We investigate how variable image quality affects label-efficient
finetuning by measuring the generalisability of finetuned models. Experiments
systematically vary high-/low-quality image ratios in finetuning and evaluation
sets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its
finetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In
particular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between
finetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream
performance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the
finetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the
importance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between
different downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate
cancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less
labeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image
quality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained
models may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This
highlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions
between finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in
finetuning data for specific downstream tasks. Using ProFound, we show the
value of quantifying image quality in both finetuning and deployment to fully
realise the data and compute efficiency benefits of foundation models.

TL;DR: AdaRing是一个基于张量环分解的视觉语言模型高效微调框架，通过跨层共享张量核心和层特定切片来减少冗余，同时使用多样化秩驱动适配器处理不同表示需求，在减少90%训练参数的同时达到SOTA性能。

Motivation: 现有适配器微调方法存在两个主要限制：1)由于忽略跨层冗余导致压缩率有限；2)同质适配器的表示能力有限。需要一种既能减少参数又能保持性能的高效微调方法。

Method: 提出基于跨层张量环分解(TRD)的框架，将适配器表示为层共享的张量核心和层特定切片，利用张量级低秩性消除跨层冗余，并通过多样化秩驱动适配器协作处理不同表示需求。

Result: 实验表明AdaRing在减少平均训练参数90%的情况下，达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: AdaRing框架成功实现了视觉语言模型的超轻量参数高效适应，通过张量环分解和多样化适配器协作有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large
pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks
efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned,
without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale
adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity
of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited
compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited
representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer
tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of
diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient
adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists
among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to
formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices.
Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven
adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our
experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art
performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.

Conclusion: EVTP-IV是简单有效的视觉token剪枝方法，显著提升推理效率同时保持分割性能

Abstract: Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks require segmenting objects in
images or videos based on natural language instructions. While recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We
empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong
correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This
motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that
selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate
inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for
IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial
information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an
information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard
IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks
and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20%
of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art

*Quanwei Hu,Yinggan Tang,Xuguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于纯CNN的大核调制网络(LKMN)，通过增强部分大核块和交叉门控前馈网络，在轻量级图像超分辨率任务中平衡性能与效率，超越现有SOTA模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限场景下图像超分辨率的轻量化需求，卷积神经网络延迟低但缺乏非局部特征捕获能力，而Transformer非局部建模能力强但推理速度慢

Method: LKMN包含两个核心组件：增强部分大核块(EPLKB)使用通道混洗增强通道交互、通道注意力聚焦关键信息、部分通道大核卷积降低复杂度；交叉门控前馈网络(CGFN)通过可学习缩放因子动态调整特征差异，交叉门控策略调制融合特征

Result: 在Manga109数据集4倍超分辨率上，LKMN-L比DAT-light提升0.23dB PSNR，推理速度快约4.8倍

Conclusion: 该方法在轻量级超分辨率任务中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡，证明了纯CNN架构在非局部特征建模方面的潜力

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) in resource-constrained scenarios demands
lightweight models balancing performance and latency. Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) offer low latency but lack non-local feature capture, while
Transformers excel at non-local modeling yet suffer slow inference. To address
this trade-off, we propose the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN), a pure
CNN-based model. LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel
Block (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes
channel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel
attention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip
convolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced
complexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local,
and non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a
cross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their
complementarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight SR models while balancing quality
and efficiency. Specifically, LKMN-L achieves 0.23 dB PSNR improvement over
DAT-light on the Manga109 dataset at $\times$4 upscale, with nearly $\times$4.8
times faster. Codes are in the supplementary materials. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用Sobel算子提取的水平垂直边缘图作为输入，通过全连接MLP网络在MNIST和EMNIST数据集上达到接近CNN的性能，证明一阶梯度信息已足够用于手写字符识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否仅使用一阶边缘图就能驱动全连接MLP网络进行手写字符识别，作为卷积神经网络的替代方案

Method: 仅使用水平和垂直Sobel导数作为输入，在MNIST和EMNIST Letters数据集上训练多层感知机(MLP)

Result: 在MNIST数字上达到98%准确率，在EMNIST字母上达到92%准确率，接近CNN性能但具有更小的内存占用和更透明的特征

Conclusion: 手写字符图像中的类判别信息大部分已被一阶梯度捕获，边缘感知的MLP是HCR的一个有吸引力的选择

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are
first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron
(MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to
convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel
derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its
extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits
and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory
footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the
class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already
captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option
for HCR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频定位新任务OVG-HQ，支持文本、图像、视频片段等多模态查询，解决了传统方法在流媒体和视觉查询场景的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频定位方法在处理流媒体视频和使用视觉线索的查询时存在不足，需要支持多模态查询的在线定位解决方案。

Method: 提出OVG-HQ-Unify统一框架，包含参数记忆块(PMB)保持历史知识和跨模态蒸馏策略平衡模态学习，构建QVHighlights-Unify多模态数据集。

Result: 实验表明OVG-HQ-Unify优于现有模型，在准确性和效率方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: 该框架为在线混合模态视频定位提供了强大解决方案，解决了上下文有限和模态不平衡等挑战。

Abstract: Video grounding (VG) task focuses on locating specific moments in a video
based on a query, usually in text form. However, traditional VG struggles with
some scenarios like streaming video or queries using visual cues. To fill this
gap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal
Queries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images,
video segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges:
limited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training,
where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose
OVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB)
that retain previously learned knowledge to enhance current decision and a
cross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant
modalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle
hybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct
QVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries. Besides,
since offline metrics overlook prediction timeliness, we adapt them to the
online setting, introducing oR@n, IoU=m, and online mean Average Precision
(omAP) to evaluate both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show that our
OVG-HQ-Unify outperforms existing models, offering a robust solution for
online, hybrid-modal video grounding. Source code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeCtrl是一个轻量级非侵入式插件，通过检测-抑制范式精准定位不安全内容并抑制有害语义，而非硬性替换，在保持安全性和保真度方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型安全方法存在安全性与保真度的权衡问题，基于概念替换的定位方法可能导致语义不连贯，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 采用检测-抑制范式，首先精确定位不安全内容，然后抑制有害语义而非硬性替换；使用直接偏好优化(DPO)训练策略，利用图像级偏好数据学习细微的抑制行为。

Result: 实验表明SafeCtrl在安全有效性和保真度保持方面显著优于最先进方法，无需昂贵的像素级标注即可实现区域引导干预。

Conclusion: 解耦的基于抑制的控制是构建更负责任生成模型的高效且可扩展方向，能够自然连贯地生成安全、上下文感知的替代内容。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of text-to-image models is challenged by their
potential to generate harmful content. While existing safety methods, such as
prompt rewriting or model fine-tuning, provide valuable interventions, they
often introduce a trade-off between safety and fidelity. Recent
localization-based approaches have shown promise, yet their reliance on
explicit ``concept replacement" can sometimes lead to semantic incongruity. To
address these limitations, we explore a more flexible detect-then-suppress
paradigm. We introduce SafeCtrl, a lightweight, non-intrusive plugin that first
precisely localizes unsafe content. Instead of performing a hard A-to-B
substitution, SafeCtrl then suppresses the harmful semantics, allowing the
generative process to naturally and coherently resolve into a safe,
context-aware alternative. A key aspect of our work is a novel training
strategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We leverage readily
available, image-level preference data to train our module, enabling it to
learn nuanced suppression behaviors and perform region-guided interventions at
inference without requiring costly, pixel-level annotations. Extensive
experiments show that SafeCtrl significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both safety efficacy and fidelity preservation. Our findings suggest
that decoupled, suppression-based control is a highly effective and scalable
direction for building more responsible generative models.

TL;DR: TimeSenCLIP是一个轻量级框架，利用单像素的时序和光谱信息进行土地利用分类，减少对空间上下文和文本监督的依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在遥感应用中面临两个关键挑战：依赖大空间图块增加计算成本，以及依赖文本监督但文本数据往往不易获得

Method: 利用Sentinel-2影像的光谱和时序信息，通过与地理标记地面照片的跨视角学习，最小化基于标题训练的需求，同时保持卫星和地面视角之间的语义对齐

Result: 实验证明单像素输入结合时序和光谱线索足以进行专题制图，为大规模遥感应用提供了可扩展和高效的替代方案

Conclusion: 该方法在LUCAS和Sen4Map数据集上评估了土地利用、作物类型和生态系统类型分类任务，展示了单像素时序光谱方法的有效性

Abstract: Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing
applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot
classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key
challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost,
and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available.
In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate
the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel
by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and
ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from
Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos,
we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic
alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is
grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification
tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single
pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for
thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale
remote sensing applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤MRI分割中面临的肿瘤异质性、标注数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，通过合成数据增强数据集多样性。

Method: 使用预训练GAN模型生成合成MRI数据，结合BraTS 2020真实数据，以不同比例混合训练U-Net分割网络，评估Dice系数、IoU等指标。

Result: 混合数据集与纯真实数据在定量性能上相当，但40%真实+60%合成的配置能改善全肿瘤边界分割，肿瘤核心和增强区域精度仍较低。

Conclusion: 合成数据可作为脑肿瘤分割的有效增强策略，但需要更大规模实验、体积数据一致性和更好的类别不平衡处理。

Abstract: Manual brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is challenging due to tumor
heterogeneity, scarcity of annotated data, and class imbalance in medical
imaging datasets. Synthetic data generated by generative models has the
potential to mitigate these issues by improving dataset diversity. This study
investigates, as a proof of concept, the impact of incorporating synthetic MRI
data, generated using a pre-trained GAN model, into training a U-Net
segmentation network. Experiments were conducted using real data from the BraTS
2020 dataset, synthetic data generated with the medigan library, and hybrid
datasets combining real and synthetic samples in varying proportions. While
overall quantitative performance (Dice coefficient, IoU, precision, recall,
accuracy) was comparable between real-only and hybrid-trained models,
qualitative inspection suggested that hybrid datasets, particularly with 40%
real and 60% synthetic data, improved whole tumor boundary delineation.
However, region-wise accuracy for the tumor core and the enhancing tumor
remained lower, indicating a persistent class imbalance. The findings support
the feasibility of synthetic data as an augmentation strategy for brain tumor
segmentation, while highlighting the need for larger-scale experiments,
volumetric data consistency, and mitigating class imbalance in future work.

Motivation: 现实世界中的点云数据普遍存在各种模态和强度的噪声，点云去噪作为预处理步骤对下游任务性能至关重要。尽管深度学习方法在去噪性能上已超越传统方法，但缺乏系统性的综述总结。

Method: 将点云去噪分为两个步骤：异常值去除和表面噪声恢复，并据此构建分类体系。系统比较了现有方法的相似性、差异性和各自优势。

Result: 提出了一个专门针对去噪任务的分类体系，涵盖了大多数点云去噪场景和需求。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了当前研究的局限性并指出了未来发展方向，为点云去噪领域的进一步进展提供了见解。

Abstract: Real-world environment-derived point clouds invariably exhibit noise across
varying modalities and intensities. Hence, point cloud denoising (PCD) is
essential as a preprocessing step to improve downstream task performance. Deep
learning (DL)-based PCD models, known for their strong representation
capabilities and flexible architectures, have surpassed traditional methods in
denoising performance. To our best knowledge, despite recent advances in
performance, no comprehensive survey systematically summarizes the developments
of DL-based PCD. To fill the gap, this paper seeks to identify key challenges
in DL-based PCD, summarizes the main contributions of existing methods, and
proposes a taxonomy tailored to denoising tasks. To achieve this goal, we
formulate PCD as a two-step process: outlier removal and surface noise
restoration, encompassing most scenarios and requirements of PCD. Additionally,
we compare methods in terms of similarities, differences, and respective
advantages. Finally, we discuss research limitations and future directions,
offering insights for further advancements in PCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要适用于静态或准静态场景，在相机和物体同时快速移动时性能显著下降，需要解决快速运动场景下的6D姿态跟踪鲁棒性问题

Method: 提出三个协同组件：1）视觉惯性里程计补偿相机运动引起的ROI偏移；2）深度信息2D跟踪器校正大物体平移引起的ROI偏差；3）VIO引导的卡尔曼滤波器预测物体旋转并生成候选姿态进行分层细化

Result: 仿真和真实世界实验证明该方法有效，能够实现实时且鲁棒的6D姿态跟踪，适用于快速移动的相机和物体场景

Conclusion: 该方法形成了一个闭环系统，确保准确的姿态初始化和精确的姿态跟踪，解决了快速运动场景下的6D姿态跟踪挑战

Abstract: We present DynamicPose, a retraining-free 6D pose tracking framework that
improves tracking robustness in fast-moving camera and object scenarios.
Previous work is mainly applicable to static or quasi-static scenes, and its
performance significantly deteriorates when both the object and the camera move
rapidly. To overcome these challenges, we propose three synergistic components:
(1) A visual-inertial odometry compensates for the shift in the Region of
Interest (ROI) caused by camera motion; (2) A depth-informed 2D tracker
corrects ROI deviations caused by large object translation; (3) A VIO-guided
Kalman filter predicts object rotation, generates multiple candidate poses, and
then obtains the final pose by hierarchical refinement. The 6D pose tracking
results guide subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, forming a
closed-loop system that ensures accurate pose initialization and precise pose
tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving real-time and robust 6D pose tracking for fast-moving
cameras and objects.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了轻量化的点云目标检测，通过单邻域近似多尺度特征和可迁移特征机制，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-scale feature approximation and transferable
features for object detection from point clouds. Multi-scale features are
critical for object detection from point clouds. However, multi-scale feature
learning usually involves multiple neighborhood searches and scale-aware
layers, which can hinder efforts to achieve lightweight models and may not be
conducive to research constrained by limited computational resources. This
paper approximates point-based multi-scale features from a single neighborhood
based on knowledge distillation. To compensate for the loss of constructive
diversity in a single neighborhood, this paper designs a transferable feature
embedding mechanism. Specifically, class-aware statistics are employed as
transferable features given the small computational cost. In addition, this
paper introduces the central weighted intersection over union for localization
to alleviate the misalignment brought by the center offset in optimization.
Note that the method presented in this paper saves computational costs.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Despite the impressive progress on understanding and generating images shown
by the recent unified architectures, the integration of 3D tasks remains
challenging and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce UniUGG, the
first unified understanding and generation framework for 3D modalities. Our
unified framework employs an LLM to comprehend and decode sentences and 3D
representations. At its core, we propose a spatial decoder leveraging a latent
diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D representations. This allows for
the generation and imagination of 3D scenes based on a reference image and an
arbitrary view transformation, while remaining supports for spatial visual
question answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we propose a geometric-semantic
learning strategy to pretrain the vision encoder. This design jointly captures
the input's semantic and geometric cues, enhancing both spatial understanding
and generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our method in visual representation, spatial understanding, and 3D generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RVOS方法存在语义错位问题，主要原因是训练时对所有可见对象进行无差别采样和监督，而不管它们是否与文本查询真正相关。

Method: 提出了SAMDWICH框架，包含：1）新标注的MeViS-M数据集，标注了对象被文本表达引用的时间片段；2）Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP)传播策略；3）Object-level Selective Supervision (OSS)对象级过滤策略。

Result: 在具有挑战性的MeViS基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，特别是在涉及多样化表达式的复杂场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过引入时间感知的监督和选择性训练策略，SAMDWICH有效解决了RVOS中的语义对齐问题，显著提升了视频-文本对齐和参考理解能力。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects
in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment
between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often
suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling
and supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their
actual relevance to the expression. To address this, we introduce a
moment-aware RVOS framework named SAMDWICH, along with a newly annotated
dataset, MeViS-M, built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark. We manually
annotate temporal moments indicating when each object is referred to by the
expression, enabling semantically grounded supervision that strengthens
video-text alignment. SAMDWICH leverages these aligned text-to-clip pairs to
guide training, significantly enhancing referential understanding. Building
upon this framework, we propose Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP), a
moment-aware propagation strategy that improves both object grounding and
tracking by training on both relevant and irrelevant frames through a
moment-centric memory mechanism. In addition, we introduce Object-level
Selective Supervision (OSS), an object-level filtering strategy that supervises
only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip.
This selective supervision reduces semantic noise and reinforces
language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments show that SAMDWICH
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging MeViS benchmark,
particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving diverse expressions.

Conclusion: PEdger++成功实现了高精度和低计算成本的平衡，具有很好的适应性和实用性

Abstract: Edge detection serves as a critical foundation for numerous computer vision
applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image
editing, by extracting essential structural cues that define object boundaries
and salient edges. To be viable for broad deployment across devices with
varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy
with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved
accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their
applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the
challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture
discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated
models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to
reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection
accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived
from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple
parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble
perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also
provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements,
highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource
constraints. Codes are accessible at

Conclusion: 事件基数据在微表情识别和帧重建任务中表现出色，证明了事件相机在捕捉细微面部运动方面的优势，为微表情分析提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot
Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast
facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to
limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event
cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic
range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based
recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a
novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset
recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting
conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal
dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural
Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame
reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM =
0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising
results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition
and frame reconstruction.

rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For
product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures
drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one
alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue
that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant
potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,
achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:
the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the
common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a
standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the
first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation
learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for
targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)
effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the
distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the
specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity
of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark
MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model
demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the
public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream
tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute
prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the
effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

Conclusion: InstDrive成功解决了动态驾驶场景中的实例感知重建问题，无需数据预处理或复杂优化，为自动驾驶和场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted
increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene
understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most
methods still unify all background elements into a single representation,
hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some
approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on
pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to
discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor
scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving
scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic
driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D
feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the
3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities
and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static
codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without
requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the
best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance
segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are
available at our project page.

TL;DR: WiseLVAM是一个全自动的左心室线性测量框架，通过结合B模式图像的结构信息和AMM模式的运动信息，自动放置虚拟扫描线并进行测量，提高了临床应用的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化方法直接在B模式图像中预测地标点进行测量，即使预测点沿左心室壁有微小偏移也会导致显著的测量误差，降低了临床可靠性。需要开发更准确的全自动测量方法。

Method: 提出轮廓感知的扫描线放置方法：首先使用弱监督的B模式地标检测器估计左心室轮廓，然后推断左心室长轴和基底水平来放置扫描线。在此基础上构建WiseLVAM框架，结合B模式的结构感知和AMM模式的运动感知。

Result: WiseLVAM能够全自动地放置扫描线并执行左心室线性测量，提高了测量的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: WiseLVAM提供了一个实用的解决方案，有潜力在常规临床应用中实现全自动且可靠的心脏测量。

Abstract: Clinical guidelines recommend performing left ventricular (LV) linear
measurements in B-mode echocardiographic images at the basal level -- typically
at the mitral valve leaflet tips -- and aligned perpendicular to the LV long
axis along a virtual scanline (SL). However, most automated methods estimate
landmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even
small shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant
measurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent
semi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining
landmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated
Anatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To
enable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in
this work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised
B-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV
long axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this
foundation, we introduce \textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet
manually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then
automatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode.
\textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the
motion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the
potential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上超越先前模型，在需要图像-文本推理的复杂病例上表现尤为突出

Conclusion: 频域和量子信息的结合为构建智能、清晰、实用的医疗AI工具提供了有前景的方法

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum-inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Conclusion: VimoRAG框架通过视频检索增强技术有效解决了运动生成中的外域问题，为运动大语言模型提供了强大的性能提升。

Abstract: This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion
generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs
face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated
data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D
motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While
video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1)
developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that
distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error
propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion
Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer,
enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results
show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs
constrained to text-only input.

Result: PCR比现有AutoEval方法提供更准确的性能估计，构建的元数据集覆盖更广泛的检测性能范围

Conclusion: AutoEval框架和PCR指标为无监督目标检测器评估提供了有效解决方案，显著降低了评估成本

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more
efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world
applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this
limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for
object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR),
which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional
detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates
detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the
spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability
of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a
more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying
image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that
PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods,
and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance.

Motivation: 传统方法只做确定性预测，忽视了事件边界的主观性和多样性，需要一种能够生成多种合理边界的方法。

Method: 使用扩散模型，通过时间自相似性编码相邻帧变化，然后迭代地将随机噪声解码为合理的事件边界，采用分类器自由引导控制多样性。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为通用事件边界检测提供了有效的生成式解决方案，能够处理边界的主观多样性问题，并通过新评估指标验证了生成质量。

Abstract: Generic event boundary detection (GEBD) aims to identify natural boundaries
in a video, segmenting it into distinct and meaningful chunks. Despite the
inherent subjectivity of event boundaries, previous methods have focused on
deterministic predictions, overlooking the diversity of plausible solutions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based boundary detection model,
dubbed DiffGEBD, that tackles the problem of GEBD from a generative
perspective. The proposed model encodes relevant changes across adjacent frames
via temporal self-similarity and then iteratively decodes random noise into
plausible event boundaries being conditioned on the encoded features.
Classifier-free guidance allows the degree of diversity to be controlled in
denoising diffusion. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
assess the quality of predictions considering both diversity and fidelity.
Experiments show that our method achieves strong performance on two standard
benchmarks, Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS, generating diverse and plausible event
boundaries.

Result: 在粗糙室内数据集上，均方误差降低超过70%，峰值信噪比提升约6分贝

Conclusion: 该方法无需硬件修改即可让低端设备达到接近高端设备的测量精度水平

Abstract: We propose a multi-stage convolutional neural network (MSCNN) based
integrated method for reducing uncertainty of 3D point accuracy of lasar
scanner (LS) in rough indoor rooms, providing more accurate spatial
measurements for high-precision geometric model creation and renovation. Due to
different equipment limitations and environmental factors, high-end and low-end
LS have positional errors. Our approach pairs high-accuracy scanners (HAS) as
references with corresponding low-accuracy scanners (LAS) of measurements in
identical environments to quantify specific error patterns. By establishing a
statistical relationship between measurement discrepancies and their spatial
distribution, we develop a correction framework that combines traditional
geometric processing with targeted neural network refinement. This method
transforms the quantification of systematic errors into a supervised learning
problem, allowing precise correction while preserving critical geometric
features. Experimental results in our rough indoor rooms dataset show
significant improvements in measurement accuracy, with mean square error (MSE)
reductions exceeding 70% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements of
approximately 6 decibels. This approach enables low-end devices to achieve
measurement uncertainty levels approaching those of high-end devices without
hardware modifications.

Conclusion: 提出的理论框架和补偿方案为低精度扩散模型提供了有效的误差控制方法，达到SOTA性能

Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing
unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their
large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive
iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization(PTQ)
provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature
of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate
progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To
address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically
formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step
quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form
solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive
experiments across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation
strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing
existing PTQ methods to achieve state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance on
low-precision diffusion models.

Abstract: Vision-and-language models (VLMs) have been increasingly explored in the
medical domain, particularly following the success of CLIP in general domain.
However, unlike the relatively straightforward pairing of 2D images and text,
curating large-scale paired data in the medical field for volumetric modalities
such as CT scans remains a challenging and time-intensive process. This
difficulty often limits the performance on downstream tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework,
termed as \textbf{VELVET-Med}, specifically designed for limited volumetric
data such as 3D CT and associated radiology reports. Instead of relying on
large-scale data collection, our method focuses on the development of effective
pre-training objectives and model architectures. The key contributions are: 1)
We incorporate uni-modal self-supervised learning into VLP framework, which are
often underexplored in the existing literature. 2) We propose a novel language
encoder, termed as \textbf{TriBERT}, for learning multi-level textual
semantics. 3) We devise the hierarchical contrastive learning to capture
multi-level vision-language correspondence. Using only 38,875 scan-report
pairs, our approach seeks to uncover rich spatial and semantic relationships
embedded in volumetric medical images and corresponding clinical narratives,
thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned encoders. The
resulting encoders exhibit strong transferability, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, including 3D segmentation,
cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现优异，但在多模态场景下的长链思维推理能力尚未充分探索，需要开发更强大的视觉推理能力。

Method: 提出Simple o3框架，集成动态工具交互（裁剪、缩放、重用），通过"观察-推理-行动"循环生成高质量视觉语言推理链，构建了TWI-Tools-146K数据集进行监督微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，通过重用和放大原始图像显著提升视觉推理能力，基于精确视觉定位的图像裁剪使模型能有效关注关键区域。

Conclusion: Simple o3通过引入额外的视觉标记和动态视觉操作，建立了强大且计算高效的多模态推理范式，首次深入分析了不同交错推理策略对模型性能的影响。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance on
vision-language tasks, but their long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities in
multimodal scenarios remain underexplored. Inspired by OpenAI's o3 model, which
emulates human-like ''thinking with image'' through iterative visual
transformations and linguistic reasoning, we propose Simple o3, an end-to-end
framework that integrates dynamic tool interactions (e.g., cropping, zooming,
and reusing) into interleaved vision-language reasoning via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our approach features a scalable data synthesis pipeline
that generates high-quality interleaved vision-language reasoning chains via an
''observe-reason-act'' cycle, complete with executable visual operations and
rigorous verification, yielding the open-source TWI-Tools-146K dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate Simple o3's superior performance on diverse
benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches. By combining enhanced reasoning
capabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable
paradigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first
in-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering
insights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing
additional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and
magnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual
reasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise
visual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or
regions, further enhancing its capabilities.

Abstract: Virtual Try-On technology has garnered significant attention for its
potential to transform the online fashion retail experience by allowing users
to visualize how garments would look on them without physical trials. While
recent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved
perceptual quality, they often fail to preserve fine-grained garment details
such as logos and printed text elements that are critical for brand integrity
and customer trust. In this work, we propose DualFit, a hybrid VTON pipeline
that addresses this limitation by two-stage approach. In the first stage,
DualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned
flow field, ensuring high-fidelity preservation. In the second stage, a
fidelity-preserving try-on module synthesizes the final output by blending the
warped garment with preserved human regions. Particularly, to guide this
process, we introduce a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask, enabling
the model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly
around garment seams. Extensive qualitative results show that DualFit achieves
visually seamless try-on results while faithfully maintaining high-frequency
garment details, striking an effective balance between reconstruction accuracy
and perceptual realism.

TL;DR: TriQDef是一个三级量化感知防御框架，通过特征不对齐惩罚和梯度感知失谐惩罚来破坏跨位宽补丁对抗攻击的可转移性，在保持高精度的同时将攻击成功率降低40%以上

Motivation: 量化神经网络(QNNs)虽然对像素级攻击有鲁棒性，但对跨位宽的补丁对抗攻击存在泛化漏洞，现有防御方法要么过拟合固定量化设置，要么无法解决这种跨位宽泛化脆弱性

Method: TriQDef包含三个组件：1)特征不对齐惩罚(FDP)通过惩罚中间表示的感知相似性来强制语义不一致；2)梯度感知失谐惩罚(GPDP)通过边缘IoU和HOG余弦度量最小化结构方向一致性来显式错位输入梯度；3)联合量化感知训练协议在多个量化级别上统一这些惩罚

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TriQDef在未见过的补丁和量化组合上将攻击成功率(ASR)降低了40%以上，同时保持了高清洁精度

Conclusion: 研究强调了破坏语义和感知梯度对齐对于减轻QNNs中补丁可转移性的重要性，TriQDef框架有效解决了跨位宽补丁攻击的泛化漏洞

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) are increasingly deployed in edge and
resource-constrained environments due to their efficiency in computation and
memory usage. While shown to distort the gradient landscape and weaken
conventional pixel-level attacks, it provides limited robustness against
patch-based adversarial attacks-localized, high-saliency perturbations that
remain surprisingly transferable across bit-widths. Existing defenses either
overfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit
generalization vulnerability. We introduce \textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level
quantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of
patch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature
Disalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing
perceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient
Perceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients
across bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge
IoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training
Protocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme
across multiple quantization levels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet demonstrate that TriQDef reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) by over
40\% on unseen patch and quantization combinations, while preserving high clean
accuracy. Our findings underscore the importance of disrupting both semantic
and perceptual gradient alignment to mitigate patch transferability in QNNs.

Abstract: Large-scale contrastive pre-training produces powerful Vision-and-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of generating representations (embeddings) effective for
a wide variety of visual and multimodal tasks. However, these pretrained
embeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where
state-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated
domain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to
catastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose
visual and cross-modal capabilities.
  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve
optimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the
pretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual
learning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization
techniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective
combination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet
critical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure
reproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained
models. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and
coarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach
consistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text
alignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during
fine-tuning. Code and model checkpoints: https://github.com/nikosips/infusing .

Conclusion: KP-INR方法通过结合位置嵌入和局部特征表示，在心脏电影MRI重建领域展现出良好的应用潜力

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a non-invasive method for
assessing cardiac structure, function, and blood flow. Cine MRI extends this by
capturing heart motion, providing detailed insights into cardiac mechanics. To
reduce scan time and breath-hold discomfort, fast acquisition techniques have
been utilized at the cost of lowering image quality. Recently, Implicit Neural
Representation (INR) methods have shown promise in unsupervised reconstruction
by learning coordinate-to-value mappings from undersampled data, enabling
high-quality image recovery. However, current existing INR methods primarily
focus on using coordinate-based positional embeddings to learn the mapping,
while overlooking the feature representations of the target point and its
neighboring context. In this work, we propose KP-INR, a dual-branch INR method
operating in k-space for cardiac cine MRI reconstruction: one branch processes
the positional embedding of k-space coordinates, while the other learns from
local multi-scale k-space feature representations at those coordinates. By
enabling cross-branch interaction and approximating the target k-space values
from both branches, KP-INR can achieve strong performance on challenging
Cartesian k-space data. Experiments on the CMRxRecon2024 dataset confirms its
improved performance over baseline models and highlights its potential in this
field.

Motivation: 现有检测方法只能识别完全复制的记忆，无法量化小区域的部分记忆和超越特定提示-图像对的复杂记忆模式

Method: 提出基于分割的FB-Mem度量方法，对生成图像中的记忆区域进行分类和量化，并使用聚类方法进行更强的记忆缓解

Result: 发现记忆现象比之前理解的更普遍：单个提示生成可能关联多个相似训练图像；现有神经元失活和剪枝等缓解方法无法消除局部记忆，特别是在前景区域

Conclusion: 建立了有效的扩散模型记忆测量框架，证明了当前缓解方法的不足，提出了基于聚类的更强缓解方法

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) memorize training images and can reproduce
near-duplicates during generation. Current detection methods identify verbatim
memorization but fail to capture two critical aspects: quantifying partial
memorization occurring in small image regions, and memorization patterns beyond
specific prompt-image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose
Foreground Background Memorization (FB-Mem), a novel segmentation-based metric
that classifies and quantifies memorized regions within generated images. Our
method reveals that memorization is more pervasive than previously understood:
(1) individual generations from single prompts may be linked to clusters of
similar training images, revealing complex memorization patterns that extend
beyond one-to-one correspondences; and (2) existing model-level mitigation
methods, such as neuron deactivation and pruning, fail to eliminate local
memorization, which persists particularly in foreground regions. Our work
establishes an effective framework for measuring memorization in diffusion
models, demonstrates the inadequacy of current mitigation approaches, and
proposes a stronger mitigation method using a clustering approach.

Abstract: Emotion is a critical component of artificial social intelligence. However,
while current methods excel in lip synchronization and image quality, they
often fail to generate accurate and controllable emotional expressions while
preserving the subject's identity. To address this challenge, we introduce
RealTalk, a novel framework for synthesizing emotional talking heads with high
emotion accuracy, enhanced emotion controllability, and robust identity
preservation. RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D
facial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label
embeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce
emotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly
condition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to
synthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RealTalk outperforms existing methods in emotion accuracy,
controllability, and identity preservation, advancing the development of
socially intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from

language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Abstract: Feature lifting has emerged as a crucial component in 3D scene understanding,
enabling the attachment of rich image feature descriptors (e.g., DINO, CLIP)
onto splat-based 3D representations. The core challenge lies in optimally
assigning rich general attributes to 3D primitives while addressing the
inconsistency issues from multi-view images. We present a unified, kernel- and
feature-agnostic formulation of the feature lifting problem as a sparse linear
inverse problem, which can be solved efficiently in closed form. Our approach
admits a provable upper bound on the global optimal error under convex losses
for delivering high quality lifted features. To address inconsistencies and
noise in multi-view observations, we introduce two complementary regularization
strategies to stabilize the solution and enhance semantic fidelity. Tikhonov
Guidance enforces numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, while
Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
on open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks, outperforming training-based,
grouping-based, and heuristic-forward baselines while producing the lifted
features in minutes. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声计算机断层扫描（USCT）在肌肉骨骼成像中存在局限性，因为传统的射线重建方法忽略了强散射效应，导致成像质量受限。

Method: 开发了生成式神经物理框架，将生成网络与物理信息神经模拟相结合，通过学习超声波传播的紧凑代理模型，仅需几十张跨模态图像即可实现高效成像。

Result: 在合成和体内数据（乳房、手臂、腿部）上，该方法在10分钟内重建出组织参数的3D图谱，对肌肉和骨骼的生物力学特性敏感，分辨率与MRI相当。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了强散射环境下的计算瓶颈，推动了USCT在肌肉骨骼疾病常规临床评估中的应用。

Abstract: Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is a radiation-free, high-resolution
modality but remains limited for musculoskeletal imaging due to conventional
ray-based reconstructions that neglect strong scattering. We propose a
generative neural physics framework that couples generative networks with
physics-informed neural simulation for fast, high-fidelity 3D USCT. By learning
a compact surrogate of ultrasonic wave propagation from only dozens of
cross-modality images, our method merges the accuracy of wave modeling with the
efficiency and stability of deep learning. This enables accurate quantitative
imaging of in vivo musculoskeletal tissues, producing spatial maps of acoustic
properties beyond reflection-mode images. On synthetic and in vivo data
(breast, arm, leg), we reconstruct 3D maps of tissue parameters in under ten
minutes, with sensitivity to biomechanical properties in muscle and bone and
resolution comparable to MRI. By overcoming computational bottlenecks in
strongly scattering regimes, this approach advances USCT toward routine
clinical assessment of musculoskeletal disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在自然场景中表现良好，但缺乏对天气噪声影响的研究，主要原因是缺少带有像素级标注的天气噪声数据集。

Method: 构建WXSOD数据集（包含合成和真实测试集），提出两分支网络WFANet：天气预测分支挖掘天气相关特征，显著检测分支融合语义特征和天气特征进行检测。

Result: 与17种SOD方法对比，WFANet在WXSOD数据集上取得了优越的性能表现。

Conclusion: WXSOD数据集填补了天气噪声SOD研究的空白，WFANet为复杂天气条件下的显著目标检测提供了有效的基准方法。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging
research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with
negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and
infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the
damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with
pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel
Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of
14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding
ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm
generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and
a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean
images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we
propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network
(WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture.
Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep
features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted
from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons
against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on
WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出SCTR框架，通过超像素分割和不对称低秩张量分解，解决了传统低秩张量表示在处理空间变化数据和非网格数据时的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩张量表示方法存在两个关键局限：1) 假设整体数据低秩，但现实数据常存在显著空间变化；2) 仅限于离散网格数据，灵活性不足

Method: 使用超像素作为基本建模单元，提出不对称低秩张量分解(ALTF)，通过共享神经网络参数化超像素特定因子矩阵，分离全局模式学习和局部适应

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，SCTR相比现有LRTR方法在MSI、视频和彩色图像上实现了3-5 dB的PSNR提升

Conclusion: SCTR框架能够连续灵活地建模多维数据，有效平衡模型效率和适应性，在表达能力和紧凑性方面表现优异

Abstract: Low-rank tensor representation (LRTR) has emerged as a powerful tool for
multi-dimensional data processing. However, classical LRTR-based methods face
two critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is
low-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with
significant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete
meshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor
Representation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling
of multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our
approach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation
that semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics
than holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This
design not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances
adaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel
asymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific
factor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized
heads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local
adaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel
commonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation
that is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with
adaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate
that SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods
across multispectral images, videos, and color images.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the
ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more
context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as
Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this
limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond
to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information
of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose
Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which
incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to
utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual
content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we
introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset
that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal
personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free
evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the
region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL
models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental
results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding
performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications
in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation. Our data, model and benchmark

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by discrete binary activations,
offer high computational efficiency and low energy consumption, making them
well-suited for computation-intensive tasks such as stereo image restoration.
In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network
for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven
paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary
spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on
operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are
incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed
SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and
hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of
binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic
Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual
learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM)
module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication
and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation.
Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further
improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature
interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive
experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak
removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution
demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while
significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the
potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be
available after the article is accepted.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with
varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational
limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when
deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network
according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving
hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control
mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel --
allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware
constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model
scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific
optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and
performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to
efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets.
Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through
automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity
and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate
Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in
alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA
customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing
hardware utilization.

Conclusion: CLAIR方法有效解决了弱监督零样本跨域图像检索中的噪声伪标签问题，通过多层次的对比学习和跨域对齐技术显著提升了检索性能，特别是在处理新类别时展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: The recent growth of large foundation models that can easily generate
pseudo-labels for huge quantity of unlabeled data makes unsupervised Zero-Shot
Cross-Domain Image Retrieval (UZS-CDIR) less relevant. In this paper, we
therefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with
noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this
end, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score
from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we
design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images
into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to
alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping
function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image
features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image
features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization
ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of
learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin,
Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR
consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive performance in
real-time rendering, its densification strategy often results in suboptimal
reconstruction quality. In this work, we present a comprehensive improvement to
the densification pipeline of 3DGS from three perspectives: when to densify,
how to densify, and how to mitigate overfitting. Specifically, we propose an
Edge-Aware Score to effectively select candidate Gaussians for splitting. We
further introduce a Long-Axis Split strategy that reduces geometric distortions
introduced by clone and split operations. To address overfitting, we design a
set of techniques, including Recovery-Aware Pruning, Multi-step Update, and
Growth Control. Our method enhances rendering fidelity without introducing
additional training or inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art
performance with fewer Gaussians.

Motivation: 白细胞检测和分割是医学诊断的关键步骤，但获取大量标注数据耗时且昂贵，需要开发弱监督方法减少标注需求

Method: 利用神经细胞自动机在分类过程中生成的特征图，无需重新训练即可提取分割掩码，实现弱监督分割

Result: 在三个白细胞显微镜数据集上评估，NCA-WSS显著优于现有的弱监督分割方法

Conclusion: NCA在弱监督框架下同时实现分类和分割的潜力，为医学图像分析提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案

Abstract: The detection and segmentation of white blood cells in blood smear images is
a key step in medical diagnostics, supporting various downstream tasks such as
automated blood cell counting, morphological analysis, cell classification, and
disease diagnosis and monitoring. Training robust and accurate models requires
large amounts of labeled data, which is both time-consuming and expensive to
acquire. In this work, we propose a novel approach for weakly supervised
segmentation using neural cellular automata (NCA-WSS). By leveraging the
feature maps generated by NCA during classification, we can extract
segmentation masks without the need for retraining with segmentation labels. We
evaluate our method on three white blood cell microscopy datasets and
demonstrate that NCA-WSS significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised
approaches. Our work illustrates the potential of NCA for both classification
and segmentation in a weakly supervised framework, providing a scalable and
efficient solution for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) offer a robust and interpretable approach to
image classification, making them a promising choice for microscopy image
analysis. However, a performance gap remains between NCA and larger, more
complex architectures. We address this challenge by integrating attention
pooling with NCA to enhance feature extraction and improve classification
accuracy. The attention pooling mechanism refines the focus on the most
informative regions, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our
method on eight diverse microscopy image datasets and demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing NCA methods while remaining
parameter-efficient and explainable. Furthermore, we compare our method with
traditional lightweight convolutional neural network and vision transformer
architectures, showing improved performance while maintaining a significantly
lower parameter count. Our results highlight the potential of NCA-based models

Motivation: 雷达在自动驾驶中具有长距离检测优势，但远距离点云稀疏问题严重。现有时域聚合方法会因动态物体产生散射，降低检测性能

Method: 提出DoppDrive方法：1）根据多普勒动态分量径向移动历史帧点云以消除径向散射；2）基于多普勒和角度为每个点分配独特聚合时长以减少切向散射；3）作为检测前预处理步骤，兼容任何检测器

Result: 该方法在各种检测器和数据集上显著提升了目标检测性能

Conclusion: DoppDrive通过多普勒驱动的时域聚合有效解决了雷达点云稀疏和散射问题，为雷达目标检测提供了通用的性能提升方案

Abstract: Radar-based object detection is essential for autonomous driving due to
radar's long detection range. However, the sparsity of radar point clouds,
especially at long range, poses challenges for accurate detection. Existing
methods increase point density through temporal aggregation with ego-motion
compensation, but this approach introduces scatter from dynamic objects,
degrading detection performance. We propose DoppDrive, a novel Doppler-Driven
temporal aggregation method that enhances radar point cloud density while
minimizing scatter. Points from previous frames are shifted radially according
to their dynamic Doppler component to eliminate radial scatter, with each point
assigned a unique aggregation duration based on its Doppler and angle to
minimize tangential scatter. DoppDrive is a point cloud density enhancement
step applied before detection, compatible with any detector, and we demonstrate
that it significantly improves object detection performance across various
detectors and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何感知学习的框架，用于从单视角RGB视频中同时移除头戴显示器遮挡并重建完整3D面部几何


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头戴显示器会遮挡用户上半部面部，影响外部视频录制和社交XR应用中的面部表情和眼神交流体验

Method: 结合GAN视频修复网络和SynergyNet模块，通过密集面部地标引导和单帧无遮挡参考，实现遮挡移除和3DMM参数回归

Result: 能够成功从RGB面部视频中移除HMD，保持面部身份真实感，生成逼真的3D面部几何输出

Conclusion: 该框架在不同地标密度下保持鲁棒性，稀疏地标配置下仅出现轻微质量下降，为社交XR应用提供了有效的面部重建解决方案

Abstract: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are essential for experiencing extended reality
(XR) environments and observing virtual content. However, they obscure the
upper part of the user's face, complicating external video recording and
significantly impacting social XR applications such as teleconferencing, where
facial expressions and eye gaze details are crucial for creating an immersive
experience. This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to
jointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from
RGB frames captured from a single viewpoint. The method integrates a GAN-based
video inpainting network, guided by dense facial landmarks and a single
occlusion-free reference frame, to restore missing facial regions while
preserving identity. Subsequently, a SynergyNet-based module regresses 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from the inpainted frames, enabling accurate
3D face reconstruction. Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout
the pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the
recovered geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework can successfully remove HMDs from RGB facial videos while maintaining
facial identity and realism, producing photorealistic 3D face geometry outputs.
Ablation studies further show that the framework remains robust across
different landmark densities, with only minor quality degradation under sparse
landmark configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术快速发展，需要可靠的伪造检测来确保数字媒体可信度。预训练模型的语义概念对识别假图像很关键，但伪造空间与语义概念空间的不对齐影响了检测性能

Method: 提出语义差异感知检测器(SDD)：1)语义标记采样模块利用视觉语言模型知识减少无关特征影响；2)概念级伪造差异学习模块通过视觉重建加强语义概念与伪造痕迹的交互；3)低级伪造特征增强模块整合概念级差异减少冗余信息

Result: 在两个标准图像伪造数据集上的实验表明，SDD相比现有方法取得了更优异的结果

Conclusion: SDD通过重建学习有效对齐伪造和语义概念空间，显著提升了图像伪造检测性能

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery
detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of
digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of
pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the
misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the
model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction
learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting
the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we
specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space
shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic
concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a
visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction
between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing
discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery
feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies
to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two
standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD,
which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.

optimized for such downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AquaFeat, a
novel, plug-and-play module that performs task-driven feature enhancement. Our
approach integrates a multi-scale feature enhancement network trained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba架构在图像去模糊中采用展平扫描策略会导致局部像素遗忘和通道冗余，现有方法通过修改扫描策略或加入局部特征模块会增加计算复杂度，影响实时性能。

Method: 设计内存缓冲机制保存历史信息用于后续融合，可靠建模相邻特征相关性；引入Ising启发的正则化损失模拟像素间"相互吸引"的能量最小化，保持图像结构和连贯性。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MBMamba网络在不改变原始Mamba架构的情况下，通过创新的内存缓冲和正则化技术有效解决了图像去模糊中的关键问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative to CNNs and
Transformers for image deblurring. However, its flatten-and-scan strategy often
results in local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy, limiting its ability
to effectively aggregate 2D spatial information. Although existing methods
mitigate this by modifying the scan strategy or incorporating local feature
modules, it increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance.
In this paper, we propose a structure-aware image deblurring network without
changing the original Mamba architecture. Specifically, we design a memory
buffer mechanism to preserve historical information for later fusion, enabling
reliable modeling of relevance between adjacent features. Additionally, we
introduce an Ising-inspired regularization loss that simulates the energy
minimization of the physical system's "mutual attraction" between pixels,
helping to maintain image structure and coherence. Building on this, we develop
MBMamba. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on widely used benchmarks.

Abstract: Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR
applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly
focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how
to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of
capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and
the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is
crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic
motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction
localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,
but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although
current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting
verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training
and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation
moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed
EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric
videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate
high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify
contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide
closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for
object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot
implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel
benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric
videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream
applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and
relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种简单的离线强化学习方法，通过数据增强和扩散模型生成合成数据来解决视觉离线RL中的泛化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在视觉数据上面临泛化挑战，由于数据多样性不足、噪声干扰和伪相关性等问题，导致策略在未见环境中表现不佳

Method: 采用两步法：首先对原始离线数据进行增强以增加多样性，然后使用扩散模型在潜在空间中生成额外的合成训练数据

Result: 在连续动作空间(Visual D4RL)和离散动作空间(Procgen)上的实验表明，该方法显著改善了泛化性能，且无需修改现有模型无关的离线RL算法

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能增加训练数据多样性，还能显著减少测试时的泛化差距，同时保持计算效率，为未来训练更通用智能体提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training
agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment
interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to
generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual
data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious
correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of
overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this
makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust
agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we
propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We
propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline
data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a
diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method
across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces
(Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without
requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We
show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but
also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while
maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel
additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents
in the future.

Conclusion: IPGPhormer为癌症预后评估提供了一个有前景的工具，为病理学中更可靠和可解释的决策支持系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while
survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict
critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from
whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning
have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,
existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial
relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,
we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel
framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and
models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely
provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring
post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and
cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark
datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method,
IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the
way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成攻击研究主要关注优化集成权重或路径，忽略了通过增强集成模型本身来提升对抗迁移性，且ViT集成攻击研究较少

Result: 在ViT模型上的对抗迁移性显著提升，大幅超越现有方法

Conclusion: 提出的ViT-EnsembleAttack方法通过模型对抗增强有效解决了ViT集成攻击的迁移性问题，为相关研究提供了新思路

Abstract: Ensemble-based attacks have been proven to be effective in enhancing
adversarial transferability by aggregating the outputs of models with various
architectures. However, existing research primarily focuses on refining
ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration
of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To
address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate
models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce
the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision
Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on
the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack
method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates
augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head
dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated
parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented
models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we
introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost
transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack
significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based
attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin. Code

TL;DR: DeCoT是一个通过大语言模型分解复杂文本指令来提升文本到图像生成模型性能的框架，在LongBench-T2I基准测试中显著改善了图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在处理复杂长文本指令时存在困难，经常无法准确渲染细节、空间关系和特定约束，需要更好的方法来理解和执行复杂指令。

Method: DeCoT采用两阶段框架：1）复杂指令分解和语义增强，使用LLM将原始指令分解为结构化语义单元；2）多阶段提示集成和自适应生成，将语义单元转换为适合T2I模型的层次化或优化提示。

Result: 在LongBench-T2I数据集上，DeCoT显著提升了主流T2I模型的性能，特别是在"文本"和"构图"等挑战性方面。与Infinity-8B集成时平均得分3.52，优于基线3.44。人工评估也证实了感知质量和指令保真度的提升。

Conclusion: DeCoT有效弥合了高级用户意图与T2I模型需求之间的差距，实现了更忠实和准确的图像生成，每个组件都对性能提升起到关键作用。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models struggle
with complex, long-form textual instructions, frequently failing to accurately
render intricate details, spatial relationships, or specific constraints. This
limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal
deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To
address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'
understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core
stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,
where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic
units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and
Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or
optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments
on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and
substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all
evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and
"Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators
(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with
Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline
Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each
DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore,
human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual
quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between
high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and
accurate image generation.

Conclusion: FedCSAP通过有效利用多尺度视觉特征和风格信息，成功解决了联邦学习中非IID数据分布和领域风格多样性带来的挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has propelled vision-language models like CLIP to excel in
diverse tasks, making them ideal for federated learning due to computational
efficiency. However, conventional approaches that rely solely on final-layer
features miss out on rich multi-scale visual cues and domain-specific style
variations in decentralized client data. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FedCSAP (Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation). Our framework
harnesses low, mid, and high-level features from CLIP's vision encoder
alongside client-specific style indicators derived from batch-level statistics.
By merging intricate visual details with textual context, FedCSAP produces
robust, context-aware prompt tokens that are both distinct and non-redundant,
thereby boosting generalization across seen and unseen classes. Operating
within a federated learning paradigm, our approach ensures data privacy through
local training and global aggregation, adeptly handling non-IID class
distributions and diverse domain-specific styles. Comprehensive experiments on
multiple image classification datasets confirm that FedCSAP outperforms
existing federated prompt learning methods in both accuracy and overall
generalization.

Conclusion: 利用LVLMs固有生成能力丰富输入上下文可有效释放其在复杂多模态任务中的潜在推理潜力，无需参数微调即可实现性能提升

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
continue to face challenges in complex visual reasoning tasks that demand deep
contextual understanding, multi-angle analysis, or meticulous detail
recognition. Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and
prompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information.
Inspired by the notion that strategically generated "additional" information
can serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective
Contextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy
designed to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an
LVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary
reasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are
intelligently integrated with the original question to construct a
comprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt
guides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation.
Crucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning
of the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging
Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and
ScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms
established baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant
accuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual
understanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and
completeness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the
importance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated
perspectives. This work underscores the efficacy of leveraging LVLMs' inherent
generative capabilities to enrich input contexts, thereby unlocking their
latent reasoning potential for complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in
scene understanding, enhancing the explainability of driving behaviors and
interactivity with users. Existing methods primarily fine-tune VLMs on on-board
multi-view images and scene reasoning text, but this approach often lacks the
holistic and nuanced scene recognition and powerful spatial awareness required
for autonomous driving, especially in complex situations. To address this gap,
we propose a novel vision-language framework tailored for autonomous driving,
called LMAD. Our framework emulates modern end-to-end driving paradigms by
incorporating comprehensive scene understanding and a task-specialized
structure with VLMs. In particular, we introduce preliminary scene interaction
and specialized expert adapters within the same driving task structure, which
better align VLMs with autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, our approach
is designed to be fully compatible with existing VLMs while seamlessly
integrating with planning-oriented driving systems. Extensive experiments on
the DriveLM and nuScenes-QA datasets demonstrate that LMAD significantly boosts
the performance of existing VLMs on driving reasoning tasks,setting a new
standard in explainable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) has advanced remote sensing (RS)
analysis by leveraging unlabeled data through pseudo-labeling and consistency
learning. However, existing S4 studies often rely on small-scale datasets and
models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5,
the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS,
which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically
underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing
large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that
integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the
RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by
pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive
corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and
object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which
enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters.
This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across
diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance
across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised
learning for RS applications. All datasets, code, and models will be released

Conclusion: SRMA-Mamba通过有效建模MRI体积中的空间解剖关系，为肝硬化病变的精确检测和分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Liver Cirrhosis plays a critical role in the prognosis of chronic liver
disease. Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly
reducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and
diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection
and characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods
underutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby
hindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to
model the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI
volumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba),
SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and
combines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to
construct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient
volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we
introduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to
progressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both
the coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SRMA-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
delivering exceptional performance in 3D pathological liver segmentation. Our

Motivation: 现有生成工作主要关注静态场景或窄视角动态场景，无法提供真正的360度沉浸体验，需要解决全景动态场景生成的技术挑战。

Method: 采用双分支生成模型（全景分支和透视分支）进行视频生成，结合双向交叉注意力机制；基于3D高斯泼溅的几何对齐重建模型，通过度量深度图对齐时空点云。

Conclusion: TiP4GEN框架成功解决了全景动态场景生成的挑战，为创建高质量沉浸式虚拟环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of VR/AR technologies,
there is a growing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive dynamic
scenes. However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the
creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling
short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic
panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control
and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN
integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create
360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a
\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a
perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation,
respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates
comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene
reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model}
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using
metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our
method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the
reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually
compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes. Our project page is at

Motivation: 理解人类和AI视觉系统在感知机制上的根本差异，探索AI是否也会经历幻觉效应，以及是否存在AI特有的幻觉现象，这对于开发可信赖的AI视觉系统至关重要

Method: 系统比较人类和AI对经典视觉幻觉（涉及颜色、大小、形状和运动）的反应，分析AI模型中的幻觉样效应是如何通过针对性训练或模式识别副产品产生的

Result: 发现AI会产生一些类似幻觉的效应，同时也识别出AI特有的幻觉（如像素级敏感性和幻觉现象），这些缺乏人类对应物；揭示了人类感知与AI感知之间的对齐差距和AI特有的感知脆弱性

Conclusion: 这些发现为未来视觉系统研究提供了重要见解，有助于在保留对人类有益的感知偏见的同时，避免损害信任和安全性的扭曲，推动开发更符合人类期望的AI视觉系统

Abstract: By comparing biological and artificial perception through the lens of
illusions, we highlight critical differences in how each system constructs
visual reality. Understanding these divergences can inform the development of
more robust, interpretable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence (AI)
vision systems. In particular, visual illusions expose how human perception is
based on contextual assumptions rather than raw sensory data. As artificial
vision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:
does AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article
explores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size,
shape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these
models, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern
recognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as
pixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts. By
systematically comparing human and AI responses to visual illusions, we uncover
alignment gaps and AI-specific perceptual vulnerabilities invisible to human
perception. These findings provide insights for future research on vision
systems that preserve human-beneficial perceptual biases while avoiding
distortions that undermine trust and safety.

Motivation: 现有视觉问答自然语言解释系统存在黑盒模型透明度不足的问题，其解释可能不一致且缺乏真正理解，需要揭示这些弱点并提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 利用现有对抗性问题扰动策略，并提出新颖的图像最小化扰动策略来诱导矛盾输出，同时引入基于外部知识的缓解方法来增强模型一致性。

Result: 在两个标准基准和两个广泛使用的VQA-NLE模型上的广泛评估证明了攻击方法的有效性，以及基于知识防御的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前VQA-NLE系统在安全和可靠性方面存在的紧迫问题，知识增强方法为提升模型鲁棒性提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Natural language explanations in visual question answering (VQA-NLE) aim to
make black-box models more transparent by elucidating their decision-making
processes. However, we find that existing VQA-NLE systems can produce
inconsistent explanations and reach conclusions without genuinely understanding
the underlying context, exposing weaknesses in either their inference pipeline
or explanation-generation mechanism. To highlight these vulnerabilities, we not
only leverage an existing adversarial strategy to perturb questions but also
propose a novel strategy that minimally alters images to induce contradictory
or spurious outputs. We further introduce a mitigation method that leverages
external knowledge to alleviate these inconsistencies, thereby bolstering model
robustness. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks and two widely
used VQA-NLE models underscore the effectiveness of our attacks and the
potential of knowledge-based defenses, ultimately revealing pressing security
and reliability concerns in current VQA-NLE systems.

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is crucial for diagnosing pulmonary and cardiac diseases,
yet its interpretation demands extensive clinical experience and suffers from
inter-observer variability. While deep learning models offer high diagnostic
accuracy, their black-box nature hinders clinical adoption in high-stakes
medical settings. To address this, we propose X-Ray-CoT (Chest X-Ray
Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework leveraging Vision-Language Large Models
(LVLMs) for intelligent chest X-ray diagnosis and interpretable report
generation. X-Ray-CoT simulates human radiologists' "chain-of-thought" by first
extracting multi-modal features and visual concepts, then employing an
LLM-based component with a structured Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy to
reason and produce detailed natural language diagnostic reports. Evaluated on
the CORDA dataset, X-Ray-CoT achieves competitive quantitative performance,
with a Balanced Accuracy of 80.52% and F1 score of 78.65% for disease
diagnosis, slightly surpassing existing black-box models. Crucially, it
uniquely generates high-quality, explainable reports, as validated by
preliminary human evaluations. Our ablation studies confirm the integral role
of each proposed component, highlighting the necessity of multi-modal fusion
and CoT reasoning for robust and transparent medical AI. This work represents a
significant step towards trustworthy and clinically actionable AI systems in

Motivation: 挑战传统多模态学习需要昂贵对齐预训练的假设，探索更高效的多模态融合方法，减少计算需求并保持模态特性。

Method: 将文本嵌入映射到连续视觉表示空间，在transformer中间层进行融合，通过注意力机制的选择性加法组件实现动态集成。

Result: 在9个多模态基准测试中显示性能权衡：推理密集型任务显著提升（MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, 认知推理: +27.2%），感知任务有所下降（名人识别: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%），计算需求减少45%。

Conclusion: 首次证明对齐预训练对有效多模态学习并非必要，特别是在复杂推理任务上，为高效多模态架构开辟了新研究方向。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment
pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting
visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental
assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel
approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the
conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text
space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation
space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through
selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic
integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive
image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves
notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,
VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing
expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text
associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results
provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not
necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning
tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces
computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about
modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal
architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics. Our project

Abstract: Accurate assessment of neuromuscular reflexes, such as the H-reflex, plays a
critical role in sports science, rehabilitation, and clinical neurology.
Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and

(LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform
interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each
fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with
clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models
are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting
neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from
EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium
are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized
reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision
support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform
orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning
LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning
workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid
system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex
assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
individuals. Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to
95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination
complicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus
photographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical
settings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to
learn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a
Responsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles
across the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for
preprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification
models. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local

significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by
6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as
Disparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable
performance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to

method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates
to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for
fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current
implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and
efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces
\textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank
adaptation. Our approach leverages NAS to dynamically search for the optimal
LoRA rank configuration tailored to specific multimodal tasks, balancing
performance and computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments using
the LLaMA-3.2-11B model on several datasets, LangVision-LoRA-NAS demonstrates
notable improvement in model performance while reducing fine-tuning costs. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用交叉视图变换器（CVT）从相机图像生成鸟瞰图（BEV）地图，包括道路、车道标记和规划轨迹三个通道，在自动驾驶感知中表现良好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鸟瞰图（BEV）为自动驾驶感知提供了结构化的俯视抽象表示，但如何从相机图像有效映射到BEV地图是一个重要挑战

Method: 采用交叉视图变换器（CVT）架构，使用城市驾驶模拟器生成训练数据，比较不同相机布局和损失函数（focal loss和L1 loss）的效果

Result: 仅使用一个城镇的训练数据，配备四个相机的CVT模型在使用L1损失时在新城镇中表现出最鲁棒的测试性能

Conclusion: 交叉视图变换器在将相机输入映射到相对准确的BEV地图方面显示出良好前景，L1损失和四相机配置的组合效果最佳

Abstract: Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps provide a structured, top-down abstraction that is
crucial for autonomous-driving perception. In this work, we employ Cross-View
Transformers (CVT) for learning to map camera images to three BEV's channels -
road, lane markings, and planned trajectory - using a realistic simulator for
urban driving. Our study examines generalization to unseen towns, the effect of
different camera layouts, and two loss formulations (focal and L1). Using
training data from only a town, a four-camera CVT trained with the L1 loss
delivers the most robust test performance, evaluated in a new town. Overall,
our results underscore CVT's promise for mapping camera inputs to reasonably
accurate BEV maps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuSACo是一种基于协同训练的多模态个性化表情识别方法，通过选择相关源主体并利用多模态互补信息，在BioVid和StressID数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MSDA方法往往忽略多模态信息或将多个源混合为单一域，限制了主体多样性，无法显式捕捉特定主体的独特特征。个性化表情识别需要适应主体间巨大变异性。

Method: 基于协同训练的多模态主体特定选择和适应方法。选择与目标相关的源主体，使用主导模态生成伪标签进行类感知学习，结合类无关损失从低置信度目标样本中学习，对齐各模态源特征并仅组合置信目标特征。

Result: 在BioVid和StressID多模态表情识别数据集上的实验结果表明，MuSACo能够超越UDA（混合）和最先进的MSDA方法。

Conclusion: MuSACo通过有效利用多模态和多源域信息，成功解决了个性化表情识别中的主体特异性适应问题，特别适用于数字健康中的情感计算应用。

Abstract: Personalized expression recognition (ER) involves adapting a machine learning
model to subject-specific data for improved recognition of expressions with
considerable interpersonal variability. Subject-specific ER can benefit
significantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each
domain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and
robustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often
overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting
subject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific
characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a
multi-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on
co-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities
and multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo
particularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health,
such as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level
nuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and
generates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning,
in conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target
samples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only
confident target features are combined. Our experimental results on challenging
multimodal ER datasets: BioVid and StressID, show that MuSACo can outperform
UDA (blending) and state-of-the-art MSDA methods.

TL;DR: REVEAL框架利用视觉语言模型进行图像伪造检测，通过整体场景评估和区域异常检测两种方法，在多个领域数据集上实现跨域泛化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展使得视觉伪造检测和解释变得更加困难，现有方法在跨域泛化方面存在挑战，需要更鲁棒的检测框架

Method: 提出REVEAL框架，采用提示驱动的视觉推理方法，结合两种互补方法：(1)整体场景级评估（物理、语义、透视和真实性）(2)区域级异常检测（分割图像并分析每个区域）

Result: 在多个领域数据集（Photoshop、DeepFake和AIGC编辑）上进行实验，与竞争基线比较并分析模型提供的推理能力

Conclusion: 利用视觉语言模型的语义对齐能力，REVEAL框架能够有效检测图像伪造并提供推理解释，实现跨域泛化的伪造检测

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has intensified the challenge of
detecting and interpreting visual forgeries, necessitating robust frameworks
for image forgery detection while providing reasoning as well as localization.
While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for
specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space,
generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of
forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the
semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a
framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through
Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two
tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the
physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2)
Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and
analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different
domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing). We compare the Vision Language
Models against competitive baselines and analyze the reasoning provided by
them.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFAC算法通过仅需两张图像进行训练，解决了老照片着色中缺乏真实数据和域差距的问题，采用结构保持特征对齐方法实现语义对应和颜色迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在大规模数据集上训练，但老照片着色面临缺乏真实标签和自然灰度图像与老照片之间的域差距问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出SFAC（结构保持特征对齐着色器）CNN算法，使用特征分布对齐损失建立语义对应，结合特征级感知约束和像素级冻结更新金字塔结构来保持结构完整性。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在老照片着色任务中有效，通过定性和定量指标验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: SFAC算法成功解决了老照片着色的关键挑战，无需大数据依赖，能够直接处理老照片并克服域差距问题，实现了高质量的着色效果。

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in
reference-based colorization by training on large-scale datasets. However,
directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is
challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap
between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a
novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature
Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo
colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct
processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our
primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two
images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We
achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust
to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence
to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable
structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving
mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a
frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method for old photo colorization, as confirmed by
qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Motivation: 现有骨架动作理解方法缺乏可扩展性和泛化能力，没有能够适应广泛动作理解任务的基础模型

Method: USDRL框架包含Transformer密集时空编码器、多粒度特征解相关模块和多视角一致性训练模块，采用并行流学习时空特征并进行自监督训练

Result: 在9个骨架动作理解任务的25个基准测试中显著超越当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 该工作拓展了骨架动作理解的研究范围，鼓励更多关注密集预测任务，为骨架基础模型发展提供了新方向

Abstract: Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of
intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and
device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action
understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and
interaction. \RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and
generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is
no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action
understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense
Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model
for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a
Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature
Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The
DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial
structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature
decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce
dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module
employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training.
The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the
impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the
learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments
on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks,
covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our
approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We
hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based
action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了多模态连续思维链(MCOUT)方法，在联合潜在空间中进行推理而非自然语言，显著提升多模态模型的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的语言模型推理方法(如思维链提示)在多模态环境中效果不佳，难以动态对齐音频、视觉和文本信息，需要探索新的推理范式

Method: 开发了MCOUT-Base和MCOUT-Multi两个变体：Base重用语言模型最后隐藏状态作为连续思维进行迭代推理；Multi整合多模态潜在注意力以加强视觉和文本特征的跨模态对齐

Result: 在MMMU、ScienceQA和MMStar等基准测试中，MCOUT持续改善多模态推理，准确率最高提升8.23%，BLEU分数最高提升8.27%

Conclusion: 潜在连续推理是推进多模态模型超越语言绑定思维链的有前景方向，为类人反思性多模态推理提供了可扩展框架

Abstract: Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning
as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for
multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information
dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal
Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a
joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning
state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and
aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective
cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language
model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,
and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen
cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on
benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently
improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong
baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and
open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a
promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a
scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference. Code is

Conclusion: ViLaD代表了自动驾驶领域的范式转变，通过扩散模型架构解决了自回归方法的局限性，为实际应用提供了有效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems built on Vision Language Models (VLMs)
have shown significant promise, yet their reliance on autoregressive
architectures introduces some limitations for real-world applications. The
sequential, token-by-token generation process of these models results in high
inference latency and cannot perform bidirectional reasoning, making them
unsuitable for dynamic, safety-critical environments. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViLaD, a novel Large Vision Language Diffusion (LVLD)
framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that represents a paradigm shift.
ViLaD leverages a masked diffusion model that enables parallel generation of
entire driving decision sequences, significantly reducing computational
latency. Moreover, its architecture supports bidirectional reasoning, allowing
the model to consider both past and future simultaneously, and supports
progressive easy-first generation to iteratively improve decision quality. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD
outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning
accuracy and inference speed, while achieving a near-zero failure rate.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability through a
real-world deployment on an autonomous vehicle for an interactive parking task,
confirming its effectiveness and soundness for practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViDA-UGC数据集和CoT评估框架，用于提升多模态大语言模型在用户生成内容图像质量评估方面的能力，特别是在可解释性质量分析方面取得了显著进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释图像质量评估方法存在两个主要问题：一是对用户生成内容(UGC)和AI生成内容(AIGC)使用相同的失真标准进行评估不够合理；二是缺乏详细的图像质量分析来监控质量和指导图像修复。

Method: 1) 构建了首个大规模视觉失真评估指令调优数据集ViDA-UGC，包含11K图像，具有细粒度质量定位、详细质量感知和推理质量描述；2) 采用失真导向的构建流程，结合人类标注和思维链评估框架；3) 使用GPT-4o生成质量描述，并选择476图像和6,149问答对构建ViDA-UGC-Bench基准。

Result: 实验结果表明，ViDA-UGC和CoT框架有效提升了多种基础MLLM在图像质量分析方面的能力，在ViDA-UGC-Bench和Q-Bench基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越了GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该研究为UGC图像质量评估提供了首个大规模数据集和基准测试，通过CoT框架显著提升了MLLM的可解释性质量分析能力，为图像质量监控和修复指导提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have introduced a
paradigm shift for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) from unexplainable image
quality scoring to explainable IQA, demonstrating practical applications like
quality control and optimization guidance. However, current explainable IQA
methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both
User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also
lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image
restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual
Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed
ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding,
detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This
dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves
human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework.
This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying
and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual
features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we
carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from
ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of
GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to
the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT
framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities
across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing
GPT-4o.

Motivation: 光学动作捕捉在虚拟现实和电影制作中至关重要，但实际应用中大规模标记遮挡严重降低系统性能，现有方法缺乏真实遮挡训练数据和长距离依赖建模能力。

Method: 创建CMU-Occlu数据集使用光线追踪技术模拟真实遮挡模式；提出OpenMoCap模型采用标记-关节链推理机制，同时优化和构建标记与关节间的深度约束。

Conclusion: OpenMoCap成功解决了严重遮挡环境下的动作捕捉问题，已集成到MoSen系统中实际部署，代码已开源。

Abstract: Optical motion capture is a foundational technology driving advancements in
cutting-edge fields such as virtual reality and film production. However,
system performance suffers severely under large-scale marker occlusions common
in real-world applications. An in-depth analysis identifies two primary
limitations of current models: (i) the lack of training datasets accurately
reflecting realistic marker occlusion patterns, and (ii) the absence of
training strategies designed to capture long-range dependencies among markers.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce the CMU-Occlu dataset, which
incorporates ray tracing techniques to realistically simulate practical marker
occlusion patterns. Furthermore, we propose OpenMoCap, a novel motion-solving
model designed specifically for robust motion capture in environments with
significant occlusions. Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism,
OpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep
constraints between markers and joints. Extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate that OpenMoCap consistently outperforms competing methods across
diverse scenarios, while the CMU-Occlu dataset opens the door for future
studies in robust motion solving. The proposed OpenMoCap is integrated into the
MoSen MoCap system for practical deployment. The code is released at:

Conclusion: 提出的多领域数据集构建方法和训练策略有效提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，证明了跨领域数据整合的重要性

Abstract: Despite their success, current training pipelines for reasoning VLMs focus on
a limited range of tasks, such as mathematical and logical reasoning. As a
result, these models face difficulties in generalizing their reasoning
capabilities to a wide range of domains, primarily due to the scarcity of
readily available and verifiable reward data beyond these narrowly defined
areas. Moreover, integrating data from multiple domains is challenging, as the
compatibility between domain-specific datasets remains uncertain. To address
these limitations, we build a comprehensive RL-ready visual reasoning dataset
from 46 data sources across 8 dimensions, covering a wide range of tasks such
as infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, graphic user interface,
medical, common sense and general science. We propose an influence function
based data selection and difficulty based filtering strategy to identify
high-quality training samples from this dataset. Subsequently, we train the
VLM, referred to as Vision-G1, using multi-round RL with a data curriculum to
iteratively improve its visual reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various visual reasoning benchmarks,
outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and
Gemini-1.5 Flash. The model, code and dataset are publicly available at

Abstract: Pursuing a continuous visual representation that offers flexible frequency
modulation and fast rendering speed has recently garnered increasing attention
in the fields of 3D vision and graphics. However, existing representations
often rely on frequency guidance or complex neural network decoding, leading to
spectrum loss or slow rendering. To address these limitations, we propose
WIPES, a universal Wavelet-based vIsual PrimitivES for representing
multi-dimensional visual signals. Building on the spatial-frequency
localization advantages of wavelets, WIPES effectively captures both the
low-frequency "forest" and the high-frequency "trees." Additionally, we develop
a wavelet-based differentiable rasterizer to achieve fast visual rendering.
Experimental results on various visual tasks, including 2D image
representation, 5D static and 6D dynamic novel view synthesis, demonstrate that
WIPES, as a visual primitive, offers higher rendering quality and faster
inference than INR-based methods, and outperforms Gaussian-based
representations in rendering quality.

Abstract: Multi-modal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years.
Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial
understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving
artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly
the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading
models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a
comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and
discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at
a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1)
GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2)
still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks.
Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems
for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive
advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a
qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for
humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.

Conclusion: 提出了首个可解释创意评估选择范式，构建了首个比较推理创意数据集，开发的Creative4U系统能有效考虑用户兴趣进行创意选择，推动了研究和工业应用发展。

Abstract: Creative image in advertising is the heart and soul of e-commerce platform.
An eye-catching creative image can enhance the shopping experience for users,
boosting income for advertisers and advertising revenue for platforms. With the
advent of AIGC technology, advertisers can produce large quantities of creative
images at minimal cost. However, they struggle to assess the creative quality
to select. Existing methods primarily focus on creative ranking, which fails to
address the need for explainable creative selection.
  In this work, we propose the first paradigm for explainable creative
assessment and selection. Powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
our approach integrates the assessment and selection of creative images into a
natural language generation task. To facilitate this research, we construct
CreativePair, the first comparative reasoning-induced creative dataset
featuring 8k annotated image pairs, with each sample including a label
indicating which image is superior. Additionally, we introduce Creative4U
(pronounced Creative for You), a MLLMs-based creative selector that takes into
account users' interests. Through Reason-to-Select RFT, which includes
supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SFT) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning, Creative4U is able to
evaluate and select creative images accurately. Both offline and online
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and dataset
will be made public to advance research and industrial applications.

TL;DR: 提出Context Transfer新范式，将延迟的LVLM输出作为历史上下文指导SVLM实时推理，设计SpotVLM框架提升视觉任务性能


<details>

Motivation: 现有云边协作方法无法适应云延迟波动，且未充分利用延迟但准确的LVLM响应潜力

Method: 提出Context Transfer范式，设计SpotVLM框架，包含上下文替换和视觉聚焦模块来优化历史文本输入和增强视觉定位一致性

Result: 在4个数据集的3个实时视觉任务上进行了广泛实验，证明了框架的有效性

Conclusion: 新范式为未来VLM系统中更有效和延迟感知的协作策略奠定了基础

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, which
demand fast and reliable responses based on accurate perception. To meet these
requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative
architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task
offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs).
However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and
overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this
work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed
Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical
context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this
paradigm, we design SpotVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and
visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual
grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision tasks
across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware
collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两阶段PMRF管道，从非对比MRI合成对比增强脑部MRI，避免使用钆造影剂


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比增强MRI需要钆造影剂，增加成本、扫描时间，有环境问题和患者风险

Method: 两阶段方法：先用3D U-Net预测后验均值，再用时间条件3D整流流进行细化，保持结构保真度

Result: 在360个测试样本上，FID 12.46、KID 0.007（比后验均值降低68.7%），体积MSE 0.057

Conclusion: 该方法能真实恢复病变边缘和血管细节，有效平衡感知-失真权衡，适合临床部署

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic
diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time,
raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we
propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for
synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a
patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE).
Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow
to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We
train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and
post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360
diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and
KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while
maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the
posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores
lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the
perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出BEE方法，通过多级一致性正则化和互补锚点回放机制，在持续测试时适应中平衡探索新领域和利用历史知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法存在两个问题：1）深层预测调整浅层特征效率低，导致探索缓慢；2）单一模型在探索新领域时会遗忘历史知识，无法有效利用相似领域的经验。

Method: 采用均值教师框架，使用多级一致性正则化(MCR)对齐师生模型中间特征加速适应，并通过互补锚点回放(CAR)机制重用历史检查点来恢复多样化领域的互补知识。

Result: 在多个基准测试上显著优于最先进方法，证明了该方法在CTTA任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE框架成功解决了CTTA中探索与利用的平衡问题，通过特征级对齐和知识重用的组合策略实现了快速适应和知识保持。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained
model to continually changing target domains during inference. As a fundamental
principle, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains
(exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously
encountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite
significant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still
challenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on
deep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect
shallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions,
leading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge
of previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting
historical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an
appropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA
process. For the former challenge, we introduce a Multi-level Consistency
Regularization (MCR) loss that aligns the intermediate features of the student
and teacher models, accelerating adaptation to the current domain. For the
latter challenge, we employ a Complementary Anchor Replay (CAR) mechanism to
reuse historical checkpoints (anchors), recovering complementary knowledge for
diverse domains. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness
for CTTA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法从静态图像重建3D人群缺乏时间一致性，无法解决遮挡问题。大场景动态人群重建对城市监控和人群分析应用很重要。

Method: 设计粗到细群体引导运动优化策略，结合VAE人体运动先验和分段级群体引导优化，利用异步运动一致性损失(AMC)让无遮挡运动段指导遮挡段的恢复。

Conclusion: DyCrowd框架能够鲁棒地重建大场景视频中的动态人群，解决了时间不一致和严重遮挡问题，为相关研究提供了有效解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of dynamic crowds in large scenes has become increasingly
important for applications such as city surveillance and crowd analysis.
However, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image,
causing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical
impact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first
framework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of
individuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a
coarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust
crowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and
severe occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based
human motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The
core of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term
dynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals
with similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous
Motion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion
segments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and
plausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization
and rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no
existing well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual
benchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction
from large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd
reconstruction task. The code and dataset will be available for research
purposes.

Motivation: 人类能够利用先验知识和可见线索推断被遮挡物体的缺失部分，但让深度学习模型准确预测被遮挡区域仍然具有挑战性。现有扩散基去遮挡方法在潜在空间转换时会导致可见区域像素级退化。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 掩码补全阶段使用扩散基人体先验和遮挡关节热图提供身体结构表示；2) RGB补全阶段使用重建的amodal掩码作为条件输入，结合VQA模型提取的人类特定文本特征，通过微调Stable Diffusion解码器进行RGB生成。

Result: 该方法在严重遮挡下有效重建人体外观，在掩码和RGB补全方面均优于现有方法，生成的去遮挡图像能够提升下游人体中心任务（如2D姿态估计和3D人体重建）的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段人体去遮挡方法通过结合结构先验和文本特征指导，成功解决了遮挡重建问题，为人体相关计算机视觉任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior
knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to
accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task.
De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB
appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically
targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our
approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB
completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to
provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with
occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions.
The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the
second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To
further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features
derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP
encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder
fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a
known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent
space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances
even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in
both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our
approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as
2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly
available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法有效预测Wölfflin的五项艺术风格原则，而视觉语言模型在评估抽象图像属性方面显示出潜力，因此研究CLIP模型是否能够理解和预测这些艺术风格原则。

Method: 在标注的真实艺术图像数据集上对CLIP进行微调，使其能够预测每个风格原则的得分，提出WP-CLIP模型。

Result: 微调后的WP-CLIP模型在GAN生成画作和Pandora-18K艺术数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力，能够准确预测Wölfflin的五项风格原则。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在自动化艺术分析方面具有巨大潜力，通过适当的微调可以有效地捕捉和理解复杂的艺术风格特征。

Abstract: W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing
stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric
effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally
evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can
interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent
advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability
to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for
this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on
large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our
findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic
elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art
images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP,
on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its
ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the
potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.

Result: 在Air-Co-Pred数据集上，AdaBEV在不同模型尺度上都实现了优越的精度-计算权衡，在低分辨率下超越其他SOTA方法，接近上限性能，同时保持低分辨率BEV输入和可忽略的开销

Conclusion: AdaBEV通过精炼-对比范式有效解决了多无人机3D检测中的计算效率问题，为资源受限平台提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-UAV collaborative 3D detection enables accurate and robust perception
by fusing multi-view observations from aerial platforms, offering significant
advantages in coverage and occlusion handling, while posing new challenges for
computation on resource-constrained UAV platforms. In this paper, we present
AdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV
representations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods
that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement
Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to
enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV
grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial
subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and
background features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive
experiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves
superior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming
other state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound
performance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible
overhead.

Conclusion: TTA-DAME方法能够有效处理动态变化的驾驶场景，特别是在应对天气和昼夜变化方面表现出色

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) poses a challenge, requiring models to dynamically
adapt and perform optimally on shifting target domains. This task is
particularly emphasized in real-world driving scenes, where weather domain
shifts occur frequently. To address such dynamic changes, our proposed method,
TTA-DAME, leverages source domain data augmentation into target domains.
Additionally, we introduce a domain discriminator and a specialized domain
detector to mitigate drastic domain shifts, especially from daytime to
nighttime conditions. To further improve adaptability, we train multiple
detectors and consolidate their predictions through Non-Maximum Suppression
(NMS). Our empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method,
showing significant performance enhancements on the SHIFT Benchmark.

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用未标注数据和多角度知识蒸馏，在重复类增量学习场景中实现了高稳定性和可塑性

Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes
repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the
traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains
unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data
from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two
components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability
and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce
multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple
previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so
the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement
dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that
accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps
the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components
significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the
CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles often have varying camera sensor setups, which is
inevitable due to restricted placement options for different vehicle types.
Training a perception model on one particular setup and evaluating it on a new,
different sensor setup reveals the so-called cross-sensor domain gap, typically
leading to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact
of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this
end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA
to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport
utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant
cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model
architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the
one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View
(BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most
robust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a
novel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which
can transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying
this approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors,
mitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need
for new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles
with different sensor setups. The CamShift dataset and the sensor adaptation
benchmark are available at https://dmholtz.github.io/camshift/.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal misinformation poses growing threats to
public discourse and societal trust. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the
rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven
news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show
that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level
misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal
reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades
the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts
significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To
systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of
diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth
verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial
evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning
consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art
LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and
increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under
adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental
vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more
resilient approaches in the GenAI era.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了真实图像编辑的挑战，可以直接利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型而无需进一步训练，实现了高质量的结构保持编辑效果。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to
synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to
directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it
is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately
describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models
can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically
alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions.
To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a
simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of
text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for
unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual
contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the
extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the
self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary
networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure
preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot
image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining
the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models

TL;DR: 本文分析了稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅中的外观伪影问题，提出了量化高斯纠缠程度的CA指标，并提出了两种轻量级策略来缓解共适应效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在密集视图下表现优异，但在稀疏视图场景中会出现外观伪影。研究发现这是由于高斯过度纠缠，过度拟合训练视图而忽略了场景真实外观分布。

Method: 提出了共适应评分(CA)指标来量化高斯纠缠程度，并设计了两种策略：随机高斯丢弃和透明度乘性噪声注入，这两种方法都是即插即用的。

Result: 分析表明共适应程度随训练视图数量增加而自然缓解。提出的两种策略在各种方法和基准测试中都验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 对共适应效应的深入理解将有助于社区更全面地理解稀疏视图3DGS，提出的轻量级策略能有效缓解外观伪影问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel
view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios,
despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests
appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance
artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current
approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to
aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real
appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance
artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed
Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians,
i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple
renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians.
The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated
as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose
two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in
sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise
injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and
their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope
that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to
achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖空间特征进行核估计，但在严重模糊区域由于局部高频细节缺失导致性能下降，需要利用频率域对模糊建模的优越判别能力

Method: 频率驱动的逆核预测网络(FDIKP)，包含双分支逆核预测策略(DIKP)、位置自适应卷积(PAC)和双域尺度循环模块(DSRM)，融合频率和空间信息进行渐进式去模糊

Conclusion: 频率域表示能有效增强核建模的结构可识别性，提出的FDIKP网络通过频率驱动策略和自适应卷积机制，显著提升了散焦去模糊的性能

Abstract: Single image defocus deblurring aims to recover an all-in-focus image from a
defocus counterpart, where accurately modeling spatially varying blur kernels
remains a key challenge. Most existing methods rely on spatial features for
kernel estimation, but their performance degrades in severely blurry regions
where local high-frequency details are missing. To address this, we propose a
Frequency-Driven Inverse Kernel Prediction network (FDIKP) that incorporates
frequency-domain representations to enhance structural identifiability in
kernel modeling. Given the superior discriminative capability of the frequency
domain for blur modeling, we design a Dual-Branch Inverse Kernel Prediction
(DIKP) strategy that improves the accuracy of kernel estimation while
maintaining stability. Moreover, considering the limited number of predicted
inverse kernels, we introduce a Position Adaptive Convolution (PAC) to enhance
the adaptability of the deconvolution process. Finally, we propose a
Dual-Domain Scale Recurrent Module (DSRM) to fuse deconvolution results and
progressively improve deblurring quality from coarse to fine. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: DCSCR方法成功解决了图像集分类中的特征学习和距离度量问题，在少样本场景下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Image set classification (ISC), which can be viewed as a task of comparing
similarities between sets consisting of unordered heterogeneous images with
variable quantities and qualities, has attracted growing research attention in
recent years. How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore
the similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging
issues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image
sets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.
Existing deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively
adjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited
performance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines
traditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC
approach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)
network to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature
representations of each image set and the distance similarities between
different sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep
feature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The
deep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn
(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is
exploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each
image set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by
developing a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on
several well-known few-shot ISC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art image set classification
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴影去除任务中，阴影区域的变换与非阴影区域差异显著，需要有效整合非局部上下文线索和自适应建模区域特定变换

Method: 提出双尺度融合Mamba块(DFMB)融合原始特征和低分辨率特征来增强多尺度表示，以及双路径Mamba组(DPMG)通过水平扫描和掩码感知自适应扫描策略捕获全局特征

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在阴影去除基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的双尺度融合和双路径扫描架构能够有效处理阴影去除任务，通过选择性上下文传播和自适应区域建模取得优异性能

Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore images that are partially degraded by shadows,
where the degradation is spatially localized and non-uniform. Unlike general
restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage
abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the
transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly
from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform
correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local
contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To
this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion
and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on
transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale
Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing
original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary
artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via
horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy,
which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.

Motivation: 计算机视觉模型在机械取栓术中辅助应用时，图像质量差会严重影响性能表现，需要开发自动化工具来识别和分类图像属性。

Method: 使用预训练的ResNet骨干网络进行微调，训练九个独立的分类器来预测图像属性（如对比度存在、投影角度、运动伪影严重程度等），基于1,758张标注的荧光MinIP图像数据集。

Result: 模型在所有标签上都表现出色，ROC-AUC范围为0.91-0.98，精确度范围为0.70-1.00。在分割任务中，通过过滤低质量图像，分割成功率从42%提升到69%（p<0.001）。

Conclusion: CLAIRE-DSA作为自动化工具在急性缺血性卒中患者DSA序列中准确分类图像属性方面显示出强大潜力，支持临床和研究应用中的图像标注和质量控制。

Abstract: Computer vision models can be used to assist during mechanical thrombectomy
(MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), but poor image quality often degrades
performance. This work presents CLAIRE-DSA, a deep learning--based framework
designed to categorize key image properties in minimum intensity projections
(MinIPs) acquired during MT for AIS, supporting downstream quality control and
workflow optimization. CLAIRE-DSA uses pre-trained ResNet backbone models,
fine-tuned to predict nine image properties (e.g., presence of contrast,
projection angle, motion artefact severity). Separate classifiers were trained
on an annotated dataset containing $1,758$ fluoroscopic MinIPs. The model
achieved excellent performance on all labels, with ROC-AUC ranging from $0.91$
to $0.98$, and precision ranging from $0.70$ to $1.00$. The ability of
CLAIRE-DSA to identify suitable images was evaluated on a segmentation task by
filtering poor quality images and comparing segmentation performance on
filtered and unfiltered datasets. Segmentation success rate increased from
$42%$ to $69%$, $p < 0.001$. CLAIRE-DSA demonstrates strong potential as an
automated tool for accurately classifying image properties in DSA series of
acute ischemic stroke patients, supporting image annotation and quality control
in clinical and research applications. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 针对CdZnTe半导体图像标注难题，提出ICAF框架解决多视图共享同一标注的半监督分割问题，通过组内一致性增强和伪标签校正，在仅使用2%标注数据下达到70.6% mIoU


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CdZnTe半导体图像存在低对比度缺陷边界，需要多视图交叉参考，传统半监督分割方法的一对一关系限制导致误差积累和确认偏差

Method: 提出ICAF框架：1) IVS建立组内一致性基线；2) PCN包含VAM动态合成边界感知视图，VCM进行视图间信息交互以增强一致性表示

Result: 使用DeepLabV3+和ResNet-101骨干网络，在仅2%组标注数据(5‰)下，在CdZnTe数据集上达到70.6% mIoU

Conclusion: ICAF框架有效解决了CdZnTe材料的多视图半监督分割问题，通过组内一致性增强显著提升了低标注数据下的分割性能

Abstract: Labeling Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor images is challenging
due to the low-contrast defect boundaries, necessitating annotators to
cross-reference multiple views. These views share a single ground truth (GT),
forming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders
advanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as
they are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image
is independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error
accumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.
To address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented
perspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency
Augmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent
consistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented
baseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,
we introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency
representation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module
(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware
view through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module
(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information
interaction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe
materials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation
model, we achieve a 70.6\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2
group-annotated data (5\textperthousand). The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机视角下多目标跟踪面临的挑战：小目标尺度变化、遮挡、非线性交叉运动和运动模糊等问题，这些因素严重影响了跟踪稳定性。

Method: 1. 专用小目标检测器采用多尺度特征增强机制；2. 速度自适应容积卡尔曼滤波器(VACKF)引入速度动态建模；3. 群体运动补偿策略(GMCS)建模社会群体运动先验；4. 时空记忆预测(STMP)利用历史轨迹信息预测未来状态

Result: 在UAVDT和MOT17数据集上的大量实验表明，SocialTrack在多个关键指标上优于现有最先进方法，在MOTA和IDF1等核心性能指标上有显著提升

Conclusion: SocialTrack框架具有卓越的鲁棒性和适应性，同时具有高度模块化和兼容性，可与现有跟踪器无缝集成以进一步提升性能

Abstract: As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT),
UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the
analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems.
However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale
variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely
hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed
at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex
urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the
detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism.
The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of
trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism.
The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors
to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly
improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments.
Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical
trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks,
effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the
UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant
improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators,
highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack
is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with
existing trackers to further enhance performance.

Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型在图像风格迁移中存在三个主要问题：1）风格匹配不准确；2）可使用的风格图像数量有限；3）内容与风格不期望的纠缠。需要解决这些问题以提升风格迁移质量

Method: 设计了一种结合图像提示适配器和去噪过程中特征统计对齐的方法。该方法能够在去噪UNet的交叉注意力和自注意力层进行干预，通过聚类从大量风格样本注意力特征中提取小型代表性特征集进行统计对齐

Result: 实验证明该方法在风格化任务中达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 提出的多风格图像方法通过有效的特征表示和统计对齐机制，成功解决了现有风格迁移方法的局限性，实现了优异的风格迁移效果

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have enabled exciting progress in
image style transfer. However, several key issues remain. For example, existing
methods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in
the number of style images that can be used. Furthermore, they tend to entangle
content and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging
multiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent
content leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both
image prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the
denoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can
intervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the
denoising UNet. For the statistical alignment, we employ clustering to distill
a small representative set of attention features from the large number of
attention values extracted from the style samples. As demonstrated in our
experimental section, the resulting method achieves state-of-the-art results
for stylization.

Method: 使用YOLOv4模型在谷歌街景图像中检测自行车和摩托车，基于8000张图像/城市的数据，采用beta回归建立全球预测模型。

Result: 摩托车检测与出行比例强相关(0.78)，自行车检测中等相关(0.51)。预测模型R²分别为0.614和0.612，中位绝对误差1.3-1.4%。

Abstract: Transportation influence health by shaping exposure to physical activity, air
pollution and injury risk.Comparative data on cycling and motorcycling
behaviours is scarce, particularly at a global scale.Street view imagery, such
as Google Street View (GSV), combined with computer vision, is a valuable
resource for efficiently capturing travel behaviour data.This study
demonstrates a novel approach using deep learning on street view images to
estimate cycling and motorcycling levels across diverse cities worldwide.We
utilized data from 185 global cities.The data on mode shares of cycling and
motorcycling estimated using travel surveys or censuses.We used GSV images to
detect cycles and motorcycles in sampled locations, using 8000 images per
city.The YOLOv4 model, fine-tuned using images from six cities, achieved a mean
average precision of 89% for detecting cycles and motorcycles in GSV images.A
global prediction model was developed using beta regression with city-level
mode shares as outcome, with log transformed explanatory variables of counts of
GSV-detected images with cycles and motorcycles, while controlling for
population density.We found strong correlations between GSV motorcycle counts
and motorcycle mode share (0.78) and moderate correlations between GSV cycle
counts and cycling mode share (0.51).Beta regression models predicted mode
shares with $R^2$ values of 0.614 for cycling and 0.612 for motorcycling,
achieving median absolute errors (MDAE) of 1.3% and 1.4%,
respectively.Scatterplots demonstrated consistent prediction accuracy, though
cities like Utrecht and Cali were outliers.The model was applied to 60 cities
globally for which we didn't have recent mode share data.We provided estimates
for some cities in the Middle East, Latin America and East Asia.With computer
vision, GSV images capture travel modes and activity, providing insights
alongside traditional data sources.

Motivation: 开发自动化工具来处理大规模巡天数据中的食双星分类问题，提高分类效率和准确性，同时探索计算机视觉在天文数据处理中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用预训练的卷积神经网络（ResNet50）和视觉变换器（vit_base_patch16_224）模型，通过将相位折叠光变曲线转换为极坐标并结合hexbin可视化创建图像表示，采用分层分类方法：第一阶段分类分离和过接触系统，第二阶段检测斑点存在。

Result: 主要二元分类在验证数据上达到高准确率（>96%），在OGLE、DEBCat和WUMaCat观测数据测试中表现强劲（>94%，TESS数据达100%），但自动化斑点检测任务表现较差，显示模型在识别细微光度特征方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了计算机视觉在大规模巡天中食双星形态分类的潜力，但强调了需要进一步研究稳健的自动化斑点检测方法，以克服当前模型在识别细微光度特征方面的不足。

Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light
curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on
convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers
($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created
from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce
overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming
phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin
visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems
into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the
presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high
accuracy ($>96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$,
and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\%$, up to $100\%$ for
$TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and
WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly
successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly,
revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle
photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision
for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the
need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into
a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same
spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing
different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through
our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which
generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and
progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured
manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation
that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple
granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image
generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared
to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30
-> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to
showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models

Conclusion: DEEP-SEA通过有效缓解水下视觉退化，有望提高水下监测平台的可靠性，实现更准确的生态观测、物种识别和自主导航

Abstract: Continuous and reliable underwater monitoring is essential for assessing
marine biodiversity, detecting ecological changes and supporting autonomous
exploration in aquatic environments. Underwater monitoring platforms rely on
mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and
autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant
challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade
image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation
difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep
learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and
high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed
Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to
adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and
simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our
comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority
over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural
consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA
has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms
for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous
navigation.

TL;DR: 提出CoMuCo方法，通过多视图协作优化和一致性约束来提升视觉语言模型在跨域少样本任务中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自然图像上表现优秀，但在跨域任务（成像域不同于自然图像）中效果有限，需要新的微调策略来解决这一局限性

Method: CoMuCo策略使用两个功能互补的专家模块提取多视图特征，结合基于先验知识的一致性约束和信息几何共识机制来增强特征学习的鲁棒性

Result: 在现有和新提出的基准测试上进行了广泛实证评估，表明CoMuCo在少样本任务中始终优于当前方法

Conclusion: CoMuCo是一种有效的跨域少样本学习微调策略，建立了新的跨域基准来全面评估方法性能，代码和基准将发布

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on natural image and language data,
such as CLIP, have exhibited significant potential in few-shot image
recognition tasks, leading to development of various efficient transfer
learning methods. These methods exploit inherent pre-learned knowledge in VLMs
and have achieved strong performance on standard image datasets. However, their
effectiveness is often limited when confronted with cross-domain tasks where
imaging domains differ from natural images. To address this limitation, we
propose Consistency-guided Multi-view Collaborative Optimization (CoMuCo), a
novel fine-tuning strategy for VLMs. This strategy employs two functionally
complementary expert modules to extract multi-view features, while
incorporating prior knowledge-based consistency constraints and information
geometry-based consensus mechanisms to enhance the robustness of feature
learning. Additionally, a new cross-domain few-shot benchmark is established to
help comprehensively evaluate methods on imaging domains distinct from natural
images. Extensive empirical evaluations on both existing and newly proposed
benchmarks suggest CoMuCo consistently outperforms current methods in few-shot
tasks. The code and benchmark will be released.

TL;DR: MPS-Tuning是一种新颖的视觉语言模型微调方法，通过保持语义流形的几何结构并增强类别可分性来提升少样本图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型微调方法往往忽略数据分布的几何结构，可能导致整体语义表示的扭曲。为了解决这个问题，需要一种能够显式约束语义流形内在几何结构的方法。

Method: MPS-Tuning将特征空间中的数据分布视为语义流形，通过对齐微调前后的特征Gram矩阵来保持原始流形的宏观和微观拓扑结构，同时优化图像和文本模态的特征对相似性来增强流形的类别判别能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，MPS-Tuning显著提高了模型性能，同时有效保持了语义流形的结构。理论分析证明该方法近似了Gromov-Wasserstein距离的上界。

Conclusion: MPS-Tuning通过显式约束语义流形的几何结构并增强类别可分性，为视觉语言模型的微调提供了一种有效的方法，在保持流形结构的同时提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown remarkable
potential in few-shot image classification and led to numerous effective
transfer learning strategies. These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge
of VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting
through parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints.
However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data
distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic
representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning
method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the
data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning
explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further
sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves
both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original
manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning.
Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text
modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the
manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively
preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.

Motivation: 发现Classifier-free Guidance (CFG)在扩散模型中存在次优预测问题，导致语义不连贯和低质量输出，需要改进引导策略

Method: 提出S^2-Guidance方法，在前向过程中使用随机块丢弃构建随机子网络，引导模型远离低质量预测，朝向高质量输出

Result: 在文本到图像和文本到视频生成任务上的大量实验表明，S^2-Guidance性能优越，持续超越CFG和其他先进引导策略

Conclusion: S^2-Guidance通过利用模型自身的子网络有效解决了CFG的局限性，为扩散模型提供了更高质量的引导方法

Abstract: Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion
models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an
empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we
observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the
ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions
often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this
issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions
can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on
this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic
block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks,
effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and
toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that
S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and
other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

Motivation: 深度神经网络尺寸庞大导致部署困难，现有剪枝方法往往需要复杂的迭代过程、特殊标准，或在训练中难以有效保持稀疏性。

Method: 使用非负矩阵分解(NMF)识别重要权重结构进行一次性剪枝，然后采用精确的梯度掩码机制确保只有未剪枝权重被更新，严格保持目标稀疏度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet56、ResNet34和ResNet18模型，ONG在不同稀疏度水平下实现了可比或更优的性能，同时保持了剪枝后的结构完整性。

Conclusion: ONG提供了一种清晰的目标稀疏度实现机制，能够有效解决训练过程中稀疏性保持的问题，为神经网络压缩提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success but their large
size poses deployment challenges. While various pruning techniques exist, many
involve complex iterative processes, specialized criteria, or struggle to
maintain sparsity effectively during training. We introduce ONG (One-shot
NMF-based Gradient Masking), a novel sparsification strategy that identifies
salient weight structures using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for
one-shot pruning at the outset of training. Subsequently, ONG employs a precise
gradient masking mechanism to ensure that only unpruned weights are updated,
strictly preserving the target sparsity throughout the training phase. We
integrate ONG into the BIMP comparative framework and evaluate it on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 with ResNet56, ResNet34, and ResNet18 against established stable
sparsification methods. Our experiments demonstrate ONG's ability to achieve
comparable or superior performance at various sparsity levels while maintaining
structural integrity post-pruning and offering a clear mechanism for targeting
desired sparsities.

Abstract: Generative modelling of entire CT volumes conditioned on clinical reports has
the potential to accelerate research through data augmentation,
privacy-preserving synthesis and reducing regulator-constraints on patient data
while preserving diagnostic signals. With the recent release of CT-RATE, a
large-scale collection of 3D CT volumes paired with their respective clinical
reports, training large text-conditioned CT volume generation models has become
achievable. In this work, we introduce CTFlow, a 0.5B latent flow matching
transformer model, conditioned on clinical reports. We leverage the A-VAE from
FLUX to define our latent space, and rely on the CT-Clip text encoder to encode
the clinical reports. To generate consistent whole CT volumes while keeping the
memory constraints tractable, we rely on a custom autoregressive approach,
where the model predicts the first sequence of slices of the volume from
text-only, and then relies on the previously generated sequence of slices and
the text, to predict the following sequence. We evaluate our results against
state-of-the-art generative CT model, and demonstrate the superiority of our
approach in terms of temporal coherence, image diversity and text-image
alignment, with FID, FVD, IS scores and CLIP score.

Conclusion: CMF-IOU框架通过多阶段跨模态融合有效解决了3D检测中的空间-语义信息对齐问题，实现了卓越的检测性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal methods based on camera and LiDAR sensors have garnered
significant attention in the field of 3D detection. However, many prevalent
works focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature
extraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to
effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic
information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space
via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the
representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral
cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and
pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an
encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR
points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to
mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D
convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point
aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from
LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal
refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an
intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel
proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with
both high IoU and classification scores. Extensive experiments show the
superior performance of our method on the KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets.

Result: 使用7Bench评估了多个最先进的扩散模型，揭示了它们在不同对齐任务中的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 7Bench填补了布局引导文本到图像生成评估的重要空白，为模型的空间保真度评估提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: Layout-guided text-to-image models offer greater control over the generation
process by explicitly conditioning image synthesis on the spatial arrangement
of elements. As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision
applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A
critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual
prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although
recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked,
and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability
to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using
layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and
degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to
assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image
generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging
scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute
recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an
evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the
layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective
strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks. The benchmark is

Motivation: 当前异常检测方法主要针对低分辨率场景，高分辨率图像的下采样会导致细微异常区域的检测遗漏，现有方法在检测精度和效率上难以满足工业场景需求。

Method: 采用双分支架构整合不同尺度的异常线索，结合多分辨率特征融合策略处理细粒度纹理变化，使用检测器池和自适应分配策略平衡性能与计算成本。

Result: 在专门构建的高分辨率异常检测基准测试（MVTec-HD、VisA-HD和RealIAD-HD）上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: HiAD框架能够有效检测高分辨率图像中不同大小的异常区域，在有限计算资源下实现了检测精度和效率的平衡。

Abstract: Current anomaly detection methods primarily focus on low-resolution
scenarios. For high-resolution images, conventional downsampling often results
in missed detections of subtle anomalous regions due to the loss of
fine-grained discriminative information. Despite some progress, recent studies
have attempted to improve detection resolution by employing lightweight
networks or using simple image tiling and ensemble methods. However, these
approaches still struggle to meet the practical demands of industrial scenarios
in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above issues, we
propose HiAD, a general framework for high-resolution anomaly detection. HiAD
is capable of detecting anomalous regions of varying sizes in high-resolution
images under limited computational resources. Specifically, HiAD employs a
dual-branch architecture that integrates anomaly cues across different scales
to comprehensively capture both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Furthermore,
it incorporates a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to tackle the
challenges posed by fine-grained texture variations in high-resolution images.
To enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in
conjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to
be adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance
while effectively controlling computational costs. We conduct extensive
experiments on our specifically constructed high-resolution anomaly detection
benchmarks, including MVTec-HD, VisA-HD, and the real-world benchmark
RealIAD-HD, demonstrating the superior performance of HiAD. The code is

Motivation: 现有增量学习方法通常只关注编码器或解码器中的一个组件，限制了缓解灾难性遗忘的效果，特别是在小内存场景下表现更差

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段通过特征增强训练集成编码器学习泛化表示，提升解码器泛化能力；第二阶段使用知识蒸馏策略压缩集成编码器，开发新的更泛化的编码器

Conclusion: SEDEG通过顺序提升编码器和解码器的泛化能力，有效缓解了增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小内存场景下表现出色

Abstract: In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for
adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or
more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term
knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging
incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have
achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the
generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it
helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and
robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual
methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their
effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform
even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical
samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a
two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on
sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,
SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized
representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and
balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation
(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more
generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD
for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the
efficacy of its components. The code is available at

Abstract: Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion
MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such
studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles
manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse
bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections,
limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined,
fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data,
based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware
sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common
errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse
bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared
to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This
new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data
at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to
validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.

Abstract: Video relighting is a challenging yet valuable task, aiming to replace the
background in videos while correspondingly adjusting the lighting in the
foreground with harmonious blending. During translation, it is essential to
preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate
consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen,
an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video
generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the
control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified
paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we
construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic
videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the
community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in
diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting
simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the
aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively
unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in
synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos.
To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple
the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from
the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into
cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground
preservation. Our project page: https://lumen-relight.github.io/

Abstract: Human action recognition is a crucial task for intelligent robotics,
particularly within the context of human-robot collaboration research. In
self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based
reconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the
skeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.
However, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion
patterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.
To address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking
method for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel
framework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of
joints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal
orgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore
more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order
motion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order
motion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion
acceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach
offers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process,
enhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the
NTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla
transformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more
suitable for applications in human-robot interaction.

TL;DR: ARMed提出了一种针对开放式医学视觉问答的自适应强化学习框架，通过结合文本正确性和自适应语义奖励来提升医学推理质量，在多个基准测试中显著提升了准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学影像领域的强化微调方法主要针对封闭式视觉问答，而开放式医学VQA更能反映临床实践但研究不足。基于模型的语义奖励存在奖励崩塌问题，即语义差异显著的响应获得相似分数。

Method: ARMed框架首先通过监督微调在思维链数据中融入领域知识，然后应用强化学习结合文本正确性和自适应语义奖励来增强推理质量。

Result: 在六个医学VQA基准测试中，ARMed在域内任务上提升32.64%，在域外基准上提升11.65%，显著提高了准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究强调了奖励可区分性在医学强化学习中的关键作用，以及语义引导奖励在实现稳健且具有临床意义的多模态推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong
potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing
computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains
underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this
domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting
their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended
medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited
attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via
semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often
suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic
differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive
Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended
medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning
with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning
quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results
show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving
a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain
benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward
discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards
for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于深度学习的CBCT牙齿多类别分割方法，使用3D SegResNet架构和MONAI Auto3DSeg框架，在ToothFairy3挑战赛中获得0.87的平均Dice分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT在牙科诊断和治疗规划中具有重要价值，自动化牙齿结构分割可以帮助识别病理变化（如牙髓或根尖周病变）并促进头颈癌患者的放射治疗规划

Method: 使用MONAI Auto3DSeg框架和3D SegResNet架构，采用5折交叉验证训练，关键预处理包括图像重采样到0.6mm各向同性分辨率和强度裁剪，采用两阶段分割策略：第一阶段使用Multi-Label STAPLE集成融合，第二阶段对已分割的下颌骨进行紧密裁剪以分割较小的神经结构

Result: 在ToothFairy3挑战赛的样本外验证集上获得了0.87的平均Dice分数

Conclusion: 自动化牙齿分割方法在放射肿瘤学中具有重要的临床应用价值，能够改善患者护理质量

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become an invaluable imaging
modality in dentistry, enabling 3D visualization of teeth and surrounding
structures for diagnosis and treatment planning. Automated segmentation of
dental structures in CBCT can efficiently assist in identifying pathology
(e.g., pulpal or periapical lesions) and facilitate radiation therapy planning
in head and neck cancer patients. We describe the DLaBella29 team's approach
for the MICCAI 2025 ToothFairy3 Challenge, which involves a deep learning
pipeline for multi-class tooth segmentation. We utilized the MONAI Auto3DSeg
framework with a 3D SegResNet architecture, trained on a subset of the
ToothFairy3 dataset (63 CBCT scans) with 5-fold cross-validation. Key
preprocessing steps included image resampling to 0.6 mm isotropic resolution
and intensity clipping. We applied an ensemble fusion using Multi-Label STAPLE
on the 5-fold predictions to infer a Phase 1 segmentation and then conducted
tight cropping around the easily segmented Phase 1 mandible to perform Phase 2
segmentation on the smaller nerve structures. Our method achieved an average
Dice of 0.87 on the ToothFairy3 challenge out-of-sample validation set. This
paper details the clinical context, data preparation, model development,
results of our approach, and discusses the relevance of automated dental
segmentation for improving patient care in radiation oncology.

TL;DR: GazeDETR：一种新颖的端到端架构，使用两个解耦的解码器分别处理头部定位和视线预测任务，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端视线检测模型使用单一解码器同时处理头部定位和视线预测，导致表征纠缠。需要解耦这两个任务以获得更好的性能

Method: 提出GazeDETR架构，包含两个独立的解码器：一个专门用于头部定位（利用局部信息），另一个用于视线预测（结合局部和全局信息），使用连贯注意力场

Result: 在GazeFollow、VideoAttentionTarget和ChildPlay数据集上达到最先进结果，显著优于现有端到端模型

Conclusion: 解耦的架构设计能够为每个子任务学习独特的表征，有效提升视线检测性能，证明了局部和全局信息结合的重要性

Abstract: Gaze communication plays a crucial role in daily social interactions.
Quantifying this behavior can help in human-computer interaction and digital
phenotyping. While end-to-end models exist for gaze target detection, they only
utilize a single decoder to simultaneously localize human heads and predict
their corresponding gaze (e.g., 2D points or heatmap) in a scene. This
multitask learning approach generates a unified and entangled representation
for human head localization and gaze location prediction. Herein, we propose
GazeDETR, a novel end-to-end architecture with two disentangled decoders that
individually learn unique representations and effectively utilize coherent
attentive fields for each subtask. More specifically, we demonstrate that its
human head predictor utilizes local information, while its gaze decoder
incorporates both local and global information. Our proposed architecture
achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow, VideoAttentionTarget and
ChildPlay datasets. It outperforms existing end-to-end models with a notable
margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Compact Attention框架，通过自适应分块策略、时变窗口和自动化配置搜索，在保持视觉质量的同时实现1.6~2.5倍的注意力计算加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制的计算需求对基于transformer的视频生成构成重大挑战，特别是在生成长序列视频时。现有方法无法充分利用视频数据固有的时空冗余性。

Method: 提出硬件感知的加速框架Compact Attention，包含：1）自适应分块策略通过动态瓦片分组近似多样化空间交互模式；2）时变窗口根据帧接近度调整稀疏度水平；3）自动化配置搜索算法在保持关键注意力路径的同时优化稀疏模式。

Result: 在单GPU设置上实现了1.6~2.5倍的注意力计算加速，同时保持与全注意力基线相当的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过结构化稀疏利用提供了一种原则性方法，为高效长视频生成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical
challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing
ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and
fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal
redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion
transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit
structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads
dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,
cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods
either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting
their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a
hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive
tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via
dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity
levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search
algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention
pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on
single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with
full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking
efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标注数据的零样本神经架构搜索代理方法，通过奇异值分解和网络输出外曲率来综合评估网络收敛性、泛化性和表达能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零成本代理方法通常依赖标注数据，且大多只关注收敛性/泛化性或表达能力中的单一属性，无法在真实无标签场景下全面评估网络性能

Method: 利用神经网络层特征的奇异值分解(SVD)和网络输出的外曲率，设计了一个简化的调和平均数作为代理指标，综合考量收敛性、泛化性和表达能力

Result: 在多个基准测试(NAS-Bench-101、NAS-Bench-201、TransNAS-Bench-101-micro)和搜索空间(DARTS、AutoFormer)上表现出优越性能，仅需单个无标签样本即可准确预测网络性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了零样本NAS中标注数据依赖问题，通过综合考量多个网络属性实现了高效准确的架构性能预测

Abstract: Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) typically optimises the
architecture search process by exploiting the network or gradient properties at
initialisation through zero-cost proxies. The existing proxies often rely on
labelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings.
Furthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the
convergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the
network architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how
channel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a
neural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and
expressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the
requirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and
the extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a
result, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the
logarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature
condition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output. Our
approach enables accurate prediction of network performance on test data using
only a single label-free data sample. Our extensive evaluation includes a total
of six experiments, including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) search
space, i.e. DARTS and the Transformer search space, i.e. AutoFormer. The
proposed proxy demonstrates a superior performance on multiple correlation
benchmarks, including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and
TransNAS-Bench-101-micro; as well as on the NAS task within the DARTS and the
AutoFormer search space, all while being notably efficient. The code is

Motivation: 智慧城市发展产生了大量多模态数据，需要对多模态视觉目标跟踪这一关键任务进行系统性综述，以促进该领域的发展和应用。

Method: 从多模态分析角度出发，系统梳理了MMVOT与单模态跟踪的四个关键差异点，对现有方法进行分类（基于可见光RGB和辅助X模态的处理方式），并首次分析了MMVOT数据集中目标类别的分布特征。

Result: 揭示了现有MMVOT数据集存在明显的长尾分布特征，动物类别明显缺乏，同时探讨了多模态跟踪是否总是优于单模态跟踪的根本问题。

Abstract: The development of smart cities has led to the generation of massive amounts
of multi-modal data in the context of a range of tasks that enable a
comprehensive monitoring of the smart city infrastructure and services. This
paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object
tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally,
MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,
modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.
Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,
laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a
discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and
annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on
different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the
auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental
configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth
(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part
of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an
omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),
covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we
discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always
guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of
information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is
beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the
distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets,
revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal
categories when compared with RGB datasets.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究表明，增强特征多样性可以显著改善开放集识别和持续学习性能，促进新类别的检测和旧知识的保留


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集识别和持续学习是机器学习中的两个关键挑战，虽然已有许多启发式方法通过促进特征多样性来解决这些问题，但很少有研究直接探讨特征多样性在这些任务中的具体作用

Method: 通过实证研究分析特征多样性对开放集识别和持续学习的影响，提供实验证据来验证特征多样性的重要性

Result: 增强特征多样性可以改善开放集样本的识别，同时也有利于持续学习中旧数据的保留和新数据的整合

Conclusion: 特征多样性在开放集识别和持续学习中扮演重要角色，这一发现可为这两个领域的实践方法和理论理解提供新的研究灵感

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) and continual learning are two critical challenges
in machine learning, focusing respectively on detecting novel classes at
inference time and updating models to incorporate the new classes. While many
recent approaches have addressed these problems, particularly OSR, by
heuristically promoting feature diversity, few studies have directly examined
the role that feature diversity plays in tackling them. In this work, we
provide empirical evidence that enhancing feature diversity improves the
recognition of open set samples. Moreover, increased feature diversity also
facilitates both the retention of previously learned data and the integration
of new data in continual learning. We hope our findings can inspire further
research into both practical methods and theoretical understanding in these
domains.

Conclusion: SlimComm框架有效解决了协同感知的通信瓶颈问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to
overcome occlusion and limited sensor range by sharing intermediate features.
Yet transmitting dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps can overwhelm the
bandwidth available for inter-vehicle communication. We present SlimComm, a
communication-efficient framework that integrates 4D radar Doppler with a
query-driven sparse scheme. SlimComm builds a motion-centric dynamic map to
distinguish moving from static objects and generates two query types: (i)
reference queries on dynamic and high-confidence regions, and (ii) exploratory
queries probing occluded areas via a two-stage offset. Only query-specific BEV
features are exchanged and fused through multi-scale gated deformable
attention, reducing payload while preserving accuracy. For evaluation, we
release OPV2V-R and Adver-City-R, CARLA-based datasets with per-point Doppler
radar. SlimComm achieves up to 90% lower bandwidth than full-map sharing while
matching or surpassing prior baselines across varied traffic densities and
occlusions. Dataset and code will be available at: https://url.fzi.de/SlimComm.

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generations have demonstrated diffusion
model's potential as world models by capturing complex physical dynamics and
interactive behaviors. However, existing interactive world models depend on
bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting
real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world
dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical
context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an
interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step
auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1)
A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to
effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with
diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables
frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step
distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video
generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos
across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our
model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.

Conclusion: EgoTwin框架成功解决了第一人称视频和人体运动联合生成的关键挑战，为这一新兴领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While exocentric video synthesis has achieved great progress, egocentric
video generation remains largely underexplored, which requires modeling
first-person view content along with camera motion patterns induced by the
wearer's body movements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint
egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key
challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated
video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion;
2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the
observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these
challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built
on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a
head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head
joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that
explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within
attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale
real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel
metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视图合成技术（如3D高斯溅射）在渲染质量和速度方面已很成熟，但缺乏对用户采集输入图像的指导。高质量视图合成需要均匀密集的视图采样，而人类操作者往往匆忙、缺乏耐心或不理解场景结构，导致采集质量不佳

Method: 利用语义分割和类别识别技术，通过视觉语言模型对物体进行排序，为高优先级物体生成球形代理来指导用户扫描过程，确保对具有视图相关外观特性的物体进行充分的图像覆盖

Result: 在真实场景中相比传统视图采样策略表现出更优越的性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能识别重要物体并提供可视化指导，有效解决了3D视图合成中图像采集的挑战，显著提升了多尺度场景扫描的质量和效率

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting,
has made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for
demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting
humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has
received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and
dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed
by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding
of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to
guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect
view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated
visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of
a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image
coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we
leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a
vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked
objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior
performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.

Abstract: Human shape editing enables controllable transformation of a person's body
shape, such as thin, muscular, or overweight, while preserving pose, identity,
clothing, and background. Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced
rapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches
typically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing
unrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background
inconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is
the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and
evaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the
first large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically
designed for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in
body shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent
identity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose
Odo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive
body reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a
frozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from
the input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target
SMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
prior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm,
significantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while

TL;DR: 提出两阶段多模态框架，结合放射科医生眼动数据提升胸部X光疾病分类和区域感知报告生成性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用放射科医生的眼动追踪信号来增强医学图像分析的准确性和生成报告的可解释性

Method: 第一阶段：基于注视引导的对比学习架构，整合视觉特征、临床标签、边界框和眼动信号，使用多术语注视注意力损失函数；第二阶段：模块化报告生成流程，提取置信度加权的诊断关键词，通过结构化提示生成区域对齐的句子

Result: 疾病分类F1分数从0.597提升到0.631(+5.70%)，AUC从0.821提升到0.849(+3.41%)，同时提高了精确率和召回率；报告生成质量在临床关键词召回率和ROUGE重叠度方面均有改善

Conclusion: 整合眼动数据不仅能提升分类性能，还能增强生成医学报告的可解释性，证明了注视信息在医学影像分析中的有效性

Abstract: We propose a two-stage multimodal framework that enhances disease
classification and region-aware radiology report generation from chest X-rays,
leveraging the MIMIC-Eye dataset. In the first stage, we introduce a
gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It
integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist
eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention
loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment.
Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC
from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall,
highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the
second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts
confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using
a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates
region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report
quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results
demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance
and the interpretability of generated medical reports.

TL;DR: 使用Stable Diffusion生成合成真实ID卡图像来改善演示攻击检测系统的泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ID卡演示攻击检测系统面临真实样本数量有限和攻击手段多样化的挑战，大多数算法只关注生成攻击样本而忽略了真实样本的稀缺性问题

Method: 提出使用Stable Diffusion生成合成真实ID卡图像的方法，通过在从头训练的系统以及商业解决方案中评估新生成的图像

Result: PAD系统将生成的合成图像识别为真实图像，这对检测性能和数据限制产生了积极影响

Conclusion: 这是首批提出通过生成合成真实图像来改善PAD系统泛化能力的方法之一，为解决真实样本稀缺问题提供了有效途径

Abstract: Nowadays, the development of a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) system for
ID cards presents a challenge due to the lack of images available to train a
robust PAD system and the increase in diversity of possible attack instrument
species. Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not
take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of
the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating
synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the
generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images
generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial
solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our
images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and
data restrictions.

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型框架有效解决了RSVQA系统的可解释性问题，为可信遥感视觉问答提供了新方向

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) presents unique challenges
in ensuring that model decisions are both understandable and grounded in visual
content. Current models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and
explainability, as well as from biases in dataset distributions that lead to
shortcut learning. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel
RSVQA dataset, Chessboard, designed to minimize biases through 3'123'253
questions and a balanced answer distribution. Each answer is linked to one or
more cells within the image, enabling fine-grained visual reasoning.
  Building on this dataset, we develop an explainable and interpretable model
called Checkmate that identifies the image cells most relevant to its
decisions. Through extensive experiments across multiple model architectures,
we show that our approach improves transparency and supports more trustworthy
decision-making in RSVQA systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMS方法，利用扩散模型生成新视角图像来解决自监督立体匹配中的遮挡问题，无需额外标注数据即可显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督立体匹配和单目深度估计在遮挡区域存在对应像素缺失问题，导致光度重建模糊，需要解决这一根本挑战

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion模型微调，生成沿极线方向的新视角图像（左-左、右-右视图和中间视图），补充遮挡像素以建立明确的光度对应关系

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，异常值减少高达35%，仅使用未标注的立体图像对进行训练和合成

Conclusion: DMS是一种模型无关的即插即用方法，能有效增强自监督立体匹配和深度估计，为解决遮挡问题提供了新思路

Abstract: While supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation have advanced
significantly with learning-based algorithms, self-supervised methods using
stereo images as supervision signals have received relatively less focus and
require further investigation. A primary challenge arises from ambiguity
introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing
corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as
occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit
photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that
utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along
the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we
finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:
left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the
right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right
cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit
photometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''
method that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular
depth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both
training and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了RT-DETR-L和RT-DETR-X两种模型在海滩垃圾检测中的性能，发现RT-DETR-X精度略高但计算成本显著，RT-DETR-L在速度与精度平衡上更具实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海岸污染是全球性环境问题，需要可扩展的自动化监测解决方案。本研究旨在探索最先进的实时检测Transformer模型在海滩垃圾自动检测和计数中的应用效果。

Method: 使用公开可用的海岸垃圾数据集，对RT-DETR-Large和RT-DETR-Extra-Large两种模型变体进行严格的比较分析，评估其在目标检测任务中的性能表现。

Result: RT-DETR-X模型达到mAP@50为0.816和mAP@50-95为0.612，略优于RT-DETR-L的0.810和0.606。但RT-DETR-L推理时间仅20.1ms，显著快于RT-DETR-X的34.5ms。

Conclusion: RT-DETR-L模型在处理速度和检测精度之间提供了更好的平衡，更适合实时野外部署，为基于Transformer的先进检测器在环境保护中的应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Coastal pollution is a pressing global environmental issue, necessitating
scalable and automated solutions for monitoring and management. This study
investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a
state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated
detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is
conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and
RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of
coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves
marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU
(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's
0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized
at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a
substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the
RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more
practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its
superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research
provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based
detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs
between model complexity and operational viability.

Motivation: 现有动作驱动视频生成方法面临精度与通用性的权衡：文本、原始动作或粗糙掩码方法通用但缺乏精度，而智能体中心动作信号精度高但跨域迁移性差。

Method: 提出将动作渲染为精确的视觉提示（视觉骨架）作为域无关表示，保持几何精度和跨域适应性；构建从人-物交互和灵巧机器人操作数据中提取骨架的鲁棒流程，通过轻量级微调将视觉骨架集成到预训练视频生成模型中。

Conclusion: 视觉动作提示提供了一种平衡动作精度和动态迁移性的统一表示方法，为复杂高自由度交互的动作到视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for
action-to-video generation of complex high-DoF interactions while maintaining
transferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation
faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive
actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while
agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain
transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we
propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic
representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain
adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for
their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct
skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions
(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of
action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into
pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable
precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of
cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同骨骼拓扑结构角色间动作迁移的挑战，现有方法难以建立一对一骨骼对应关系，且缺乏大规模配对数据集

Method: 基于稀疏骨骼对应关系，仅需目标骨骼上的一到几个示例动作，无需训练即可实现动作迁移

Result: 在相似骨骼和跨物种骨骼迁移场景中均表现出高效可靠的性能，成功集成到下游应用和用户界面

Conclusion: 该方法具有工业应用潜力，为不同拓扑结构角色间的动作迁移提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: This work studies the challenge of transfer animations between characters
whose skeletal topologies differ substantially. While many techniques have
advanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse
topologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent
topological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts
the establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,
the current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different
topological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven
approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,
training-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only
one or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set
of bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
Motion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both
similar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical
utility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in
downstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for
industrial applications. Code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多阶段重建流程容易出错且难以扩展，而密集扫描每个对象的方法不实用。需要一种能够处理遮挡、实现高保真渲染和对象级场景操作的新方法

Method: 构建分割感知的高斯场，在多个扫描之间强制执行双向光度和语义一致性，引入伪中间场景状态进行统一对齐，并使用协作共剪枝策略来优化几何结构

Result: 实验验证了该框架对新场景配置的强大泛化能力，证明了其在真实世界3D重建和真实到仿真转换中的有效性

Conclusion: IGFuse能够实现高保真渲染和对象级场景操作，无需密集观测或复杂流程，为3D场景重建提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Reconstructing complete and interactive 3D scenes remains a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and robotics, particularly due to persistent
object occlusions and limited sensor coverage. Multiview observations from a
single scene scan often fail to capture the full structural details. Existing
approaches typically rely on multi stage pipelines, such as segmentation,
background completion, and inpainting or require per-object dense scanning,
both of which are error-prone, and not easily scalable. We propose IGFuse, a
novel framework that reconstructs interactive Gaussian scene by fusing
observations from multiple scans, where natural object rearrangement between
captures reveal previously occluded regions. Our method constructs segmentation
aware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic
consistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a
pseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative
co-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity
rendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or
complex pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the framework's strong
generalization to novel scene configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness
for real world 3D reconstruction and real-to-simulation transfer. Our project

Abstract: We present 4DNeX, the first feed-forward framework for generating 4D (i.e.,
dynamic 3D) scene representations from a single image. In contrast to existing
methods that rely on computationally intensive optimization or require
multi-frame video inputs, 4DNeX enables efficient, end-to-end image-to-4D
generation by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model. Specifically, 1)
to alleviate the scarcity of 4D data, we construct 4DNeX-10M, a large-scale
dataset with high-quality 4D annotations generated using advanced
reconstruction approaches. 2) we introduce a unified 6D video representation
that jointly models RGB and XYZ sequences, facilitating structured learning of
both appearance and geometry. 3) we propose a set of simple yet effective
adaptation strategies to repurpose pretrained video diffusion models for 4D
modeling. 4DNeX produces high-quality dynamic point clouds that enable
novel-view video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DNeX
outperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability,
offering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation
for generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.
