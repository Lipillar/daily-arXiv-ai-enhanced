### [1] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CoBA框架，通过语义三元组分解和选择性修改来生成反偏见数据，解决深度学习模型对伪相关性的依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型经常学习和利用训练数据中的伪相关性，使用这些非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差

Method: CoBA框架在语义三元组层面操作：首先将文本分解为主谓宾三元组，然后选择性修改这些三元组以破坏伪相关性，通过重构调整后的三元组生成反偏见数据

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还有效减少了偏见并增强了分布外鲁棒性

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够同时处理多种偏见并增强模型对伪相关性挑战的抵抗力

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

### [2] [Mapping Toxic Comments Across Demographics: A Dataset from German Public Broadcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21084)
*Jan Fillies,Michael Peter Hoffmann,Rebecca Reichel,Roman Salzwedel,Sven Bodemer,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个大规模德语数据集，包含毒性标注和平台提供的年龄估计，揭示了不同年龄段用户的网络语言模式差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性语音数据集缺乏人口统计背景，限制了我们对不同年龄段在线交流方式的理解，特别是德语环境下的研究空白。

Method: 与德国公共服务内容网络funk合作，收集Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的匿名评论，使用预定义毒性关键词筛选，结合人工标注和先进语言模型进行注释，共包含3,024条人工标注和30,024条LLM标注的评论。

Result: 16.7%的评论被标记为有问题，发现年龄相关的毒性语言模式差异：年轻用户偏好表达性语言，年长用户更常参与虚假信息和贬低行为。

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和年龄感知的内容审核系统。

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

### [5] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM在价格谈判中表现出与人类相似的锚定效应，推理模型能减轻这种效应，但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认知偏见（特别是锚定效应）在LLM中的表现，评估LLM在现实应用中的可靠性

Method: 使用卖家LLM代理应用锚定效应，通过客观和主观指标评估谈判结果，分析推理和人格因素对锚定效应的影响

Result: LLM像人类一样受锚定效应影响，推理模型较不易受影响（长思维链减轻效应），人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLM中的认知偏见，促进LLM在社会中安全负责任的应用

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [6] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Percept-V数据集，包含7200张程序生成的图像，测试多模态大语言模型在基础视觉感知任务上的表现，发现模型性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但在基础视觉感知任务上的性能评估有限，需要系统性地测试其基本感知能力

Method: 创建包含30个类别、7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，测试GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进MLLM模型以及OpenAI o4-mini、DeepSeek R1等大型推理模型

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在问题复杂度增加时性能显著下降，不同模型在测试特定认知技能时表现出相似的准确率趋势，某些技能比其他技能更难掌握

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上的优异表现与其在基础视觉感知任务上的薄弱形成对比，揭示了当前模型在基本感知能力方面的局限性

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在显著标签偏见，Claude标签总是提高评分，Gemini标签总是降低评分，错误标签可导致排名反转和高达50个百分点的偏好投票变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在评估输出时可能存在的偏见问题，特别是在自我评估和跨模型评估中标签对判断的影响

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分来评估博客文章

Result: 发现明显的评估不对称性：Claude标签始终提升分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数；错误标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点；Gemini在真实标签下自我评分崩溃，Claude自我偏好增强

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM是一种基于贝叶斯实验设计框架的方法，通过最大化期望信息增益来优化大语言模型的多轮对话信息收集能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，使其能够智能地、自适应地从用户或其他外部源收集信息

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题，使用从LLM信念分布导出的概率模型，并包含EIG估计器、上下文更新机制和候选查询策略等创新

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，相比直接提示和其他自适应设计策略，BED-LLM取得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLM提供了原则性的信息收集框架，显著提升了其作为交互式代理的能力

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

*Arash Ahmadi,Sarah Sharif,Yaser Banad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习GRPO优化的自动化HFACS分类框架，显著提升航空安全分析准确率，验证了小型领域优化模型在安全关键任务中的优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS人工分析方法存在可扩展性和一致性限制，需要自动化解决方案来改进航空事故人为因素分析

Method: 使用强化学习GRPO对Llama-3.1 8B模型进行微调，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成解决类别不平衡问题

Result: 准确率显著提升：精确匹配准确率从0.04提高到0.18（350%增长），部分匹配准确率达0.88，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-flash等先进模型

Conclusion: 小型领域优化模型可为关键安全分析提供计算效率更高且性能更好的解决方案，支持在资源受限边缘设备上实现低延迟部署

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来替代基于文本的嵌入，有效解决自回归语言模型对多语言字符攻击的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母表字符扰动攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题。

Method: 使用像素表示替代基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，构建基于像素的生成语言模型。

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了该方法对正交噪声的鲁棒性以及在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于像素的表示方法为语言模型提供了更强的噪声输入鲁棒性，并扩展了对多样化书写系统的多语言文本兼容性。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究自监督语音模型是否表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，发现这些模型在音位习得方面并未显示明确的关键期效应证据，反而延迟L2接触的模型表现更好，延迟L1接触会导致L1遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型中是否存在人类语言习得的关键期效应，即延迟第二语言接触导致习得困难，以及延迟第一语言接触导致母语保持的现象，此前主要在文本模型中研究，语音模型研究不足。

Method: 使用儿童导向语音训练自监督语音模型，设置不同的L2训练开始时间和L1训练结束时间，评估模型的音位辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型在音位习得方面未显示明确的关键期效应证据；延迟L2接触的模型在L2上表现更好；延迟L1接触导致L1遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型与人类语言习得的关键期效应模式不同，表明这些模型的语言习得机制可能与人类存在差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法在句子级生成上表现不佳或依赖领域知识，自一致性方法计算成本高，存在冗余

Method: 识别自一致性方法中的冗余（共享前缀标记），提出解码记忆管道（DMP），使用选择性推理和退火解码加速生成

Result: 实验显示DMP实现高达3倍的速度提升，且AUROC性能没有损失

Conclusion: DMP能有效提升多响应生成效率，可扩展到对齐和推理任务，与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

Abstract: jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to
retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical
question-answering, and identify semantically similar code snippets across
programming languages. It makes innovative use of an autoregressive backbone
pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token
pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this
approach to code embedding model construction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's

### [17] [Normality and the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382)
*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过正态性概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试针对的是普通/平均人类智能而非卓越智能，需要机器表现出类似普通人的不完美行为。图灵测试是统计测试，由陪审团而非单个平均法官评估。大型语言模型如ChatGPT不太可能通过图灵测试，因为它们针对的是卓越智能而非普通智能，属于人工聪明而非真正的人工智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视图灵测试的理论基础，探讨正态性概念在图灵测试中的核心作用，挑战当前AI发展中对卓越智能的过度追求。

Method: 概念分析和理论论证，通过对图灵原始论文的重新解读，运用统计学中的正态分布概念来重新解释图灵测试的本质。

Result: 提出图灵测试本质上是测试普通智能而非卓越智能，需要机器表现出人类常见的不完美行为；大型语言模型因追求卓越表现而难以通过真正的图灵测试。

Conclusion: 图灵测试能否促进对人类认知的理解取决于人类心智是否真的可简化为普通/平均心智，这超出了图灵测试本身，质疑了其所依赖的正态主义范式的概念基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动文本摘要评估中存在严重的可复现性问题，文献报告的性能指标与实际实验结果不一致，需要建立公平透明的评估框架来验证各种评估方法的可靠性。

Method: 构建了一个统一的开源评估框架，在SummEval数据集上测试了6种代表性指标（包括ROUGE和最新的LLM方法如G-Eval、SEval-Ex），进行系统性比较分析。

Result: 发现与人类判断对齐度最高的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性较差；LLM评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖性和有限的可复现性等关键问题。

Conclusion: 需要建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法论标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作全自动评审生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心评审能力上的具体表现和局限性，以评估其对科学完整性的潜在风险

Method: 开发了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下测试ARGs检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力，包括评估论文结果、解释和主张之间的内部一致性

Result: 研究发现与预期相反，研究逻辑中的缺陷对ARGs输出的评审内容没有显著影响，表明当前ARGs在检测逻辑错误方面存在严重局限

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出了三个可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，为未来改进自动评审系统提供基础

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Motivation: 医疗MLLM需要高度准确、上下文敏感且专业对齐的响应，但现有基准主要关注通用能力或模型作为求解器的评估，缺乏针对诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度的专业医疗奖励模型评估标准。

Method: 构建包含1026个专家标注案例的多模态数据集，采用三步严格流程确保高质量评估数据，覆盖6个临床关键维度，评估32个先进MLLM模型，并开发通过微调显著提升性能的基线模型。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面面临重大挑战，开发的基线模型通过微调实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，为医疗MLLM的可靠评估提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在医疗专业对齐方面的不足，并展示了微调改进的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，将词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入来揭示粗粒度语义维度下的可解释子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法通常依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示语义维度底层子结构的新方法。

Method: 使用DCSRM模型将大语言模型中的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个子嵌入编码特定语义信息，然后通过体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出了一组可解释的语义子维度，发现极性是驱动维度分解的关键因素，神经相关性分析支持了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，揭示了语义维度按照不同原则组织的结构特性，为理解语言和大脑中的意义组织提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型存在可量化的意识形态深度差异，通过可操纵性和稀疏自编码器分析揭示了不同模型的政治特征结构和稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型意识形态倾向的稳定性和深度，验证表面响应是否能反映连贯的底层意识形态

Method: 采用双重方法：1)通过指令提示和激活引导测量模型的可操纵性；2)使用稀疏自编码器探测模型内部机制

Result: 发现可操纵性低的模型具有更独特抽象的政治特征，一个模型的政治特征数量是相似规模模型的7.3倍。对深度模型的核心政治特征进行靶向消融会导致跨主题的一致逻辑转变，而浅层模型则增加拒绝输出

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLMs的可量化属性，可操纵性为研究其潜在政治架构提供了有价值的窗口

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型创意写作能力强但计算需求大，小语言模型通过监督微调缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本高昂，需要更高效的创意写作增强方法

Method: 在RLAIF框架中探索两种AI奖励策略：1)使用多智能体拒绝采样框架训练奖励模型；2)基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法，通过对抗训练和反思机制优化奖励函数

Result: 两种方法都显著提升了创意输出，但基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法生成质量更优，训练效率更高，减少对人类标注数据的依赖

Conclusion: 基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，自动化评估方法与人类判断高度一致

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的自动分类器选择方法，通过层次聚类和多样性优先策略来构建更有效的集成学习系统，用于假新闻检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集成学习方法在假新闻检测中性能严重依赖于分类器的多样性，但选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战，因为模型倾向于学习冗余模式。

Method: 首先计算分类器之间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将其组织成不同粒度的组。然后使用HierarchySelect探索层次级别，为每个级别选择一个分类器池，每个池代表不同的内部多样性。最后选择最具多样性的池用于集成构建，并融入性能评估指标。

Result: 在来自不同应用领域的六个数据集上进行了实验，使用了40个异构分类器。结果显示该方法在六个数据集中的两个上达到了最高准确率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效选择多样化的分类器组合，提升集成学习系统在假新闻检测任务中的性能，特别是在需要处理冗余模式的情况下。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过数据和模型的动态人机协同进化，为可持续的LLM训练建立了新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,

analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

*Peng Yu,En Xu,Bin Chen,Haibiao Chen,Yinfei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QZhou-Embedding是基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct构建的通用文本嵌入模型，采用多任务框架和专门的数据转换策略，在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中取得最佳成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个具有卓越文本表示能力的通用上下文文本嵌入模型，通过高质量、多样化的训练数据和优化的训练策略来提升检索模型性能。

Method: 设计了统一的多任务框架，包括专门的数据转换和训练策略；利用LLM API构建数据合成管道（释义、增强、硬负样本生成）；采用两阶段训练策略（检索预训练+全任务微调）。

Result: 在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中排名第一（2025年8月27日），同时在重排序、聚类等任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 高质量、多样化的数据对提升检索模型性能至关重要，利用LLM的生成能力可以进一步优化数据质量，实现嵌入模型的突破。模型权重已在HuggingFace上开源。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

*Jonathan Tonglet,Jan Zimny,Tinne Tuytelaars,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Misviz基准数据集，包含2,604个真实世界可视化图表和12种误导类型标注，以及Misviz-synth合成数据集（81,814个图表），用于训练和评估误导可视化检测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化是社交媒体和网络错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大型、多样化的公开数据集。

Method: 创建真实世界可视化数据集Misviz（2,604个图表，12种误导类型标注）和合成数据集Misviz-synth（81,814个图表），使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则系统和微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 任务仍然极具挑战性，现有模型在检测误导性可视化方面表现有限。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz基准数据集、合成数据集和相关代码，为误导可视化检测研究提供了重要资源，但该领域仍需进一步研究突破。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CPI-FT框架解决多任务微调中的跷跷板现象，通过核心参数隔离和融合技术缓解任务干扰和灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在大语言模型适应下游任务时存在跷跷板现象，某些任务的性能提升以其他任务性能下降为代价

Method: 1) 独立微调每个任务识别核心参数区域 2) 基于区域重叠分组任务 3) 核心参数直接移植，非核心参数使用SLERP融合 4) 冻结核心区域进行轻量级流水线训练

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著缓解任务干扰和遗忘问题，持续优于传统的多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过参数隔离和智能融合有效解决了多任务微调中的性能权衡问题，为LLM适配提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

### [32] [Reasoning-Intensive Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21762)
*Diane Tchuindjo,Omar Khattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了推理密集型回归(RiR)任务，针对需要从文本中推断细微数值属性的场景，开发了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，相比基线方法提升达65%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言回归任务如情感分析或相似度计算相对简单，而RiR任务需要更深层次的文本分析，但在实际应用中往往缺乏足够的任务特定训练数据和计算资源，现有方法表现不佳

Method: 提出MENTAT方法：1）批量反射提示优化，通过分析批量数据动态优化提示词；2）神经集成学习，结合多个模型的预测结果；首先将三个现实问题构建为RiR基准任务进行测试

Result: MENTAT方法相比冻结LLM提示和Transformer编码器微调两种基线方法，性能提升高达65%，证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 虽然MENTAT在RiR任务上取得了显著改进，但这类任务仍然存在很大的提升空间，需要未来进一步的研究和发展

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的方法，通过联合对数似然对推理链和最终答案进行评分，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有方法，使用更少样本获得更好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理任务中缺乏真实答案时如何设计评分函数来识别正确推理链的挑战，传统方法难以有效评估推理过程的质量。

Method: 提出PiCSAR方法，使用推理链和最终答案的联合对数似然作为评分函数，该方法自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度两个部分。

Result: 在多个基准测试上取得显著提升（MATH500 +10.18，AIME2025 +9.81），在20次比较中有16次使用至少少一半的样本就超越了基线方法。

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出明显更高的推理和答案置信度，验证了PiCSAR方法的有效性，为推理任务提供了一种简单而强大的候选方案选择机制。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Motivation: 网络爬取的训练数据存在质量、安全和伦理问题，但之前的研究受计算限制只能分析小样本，需要开发大规模数据集分析工具

Method: 构建基于ElasticSearch的索引分析流水线，应用于1.5TB的多语言FineWeb-2语料库

Result: 实现快速查询性能（大多数搜索在毫秒级，全部在2秒内完成），展示实时数据集分析能力

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更安全、更负责任的AI系统提供了实用的数据集分析工具，解决了大规模训练数据质量监控的技术挑战

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，混合CNN-随机森林模型以85.4%的准确率表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，提高牙科诊断效率和准确性，减少人工判读的主观性和时间成本。

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像和11,137个专家标注，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN特征提取结合传统分类器的混合模型、以及微调预训练模型。采用5折交叉验证，评估指标包括准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数。

Result: 混合CNN-随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）。预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%），其次是Xception和ResNet50。混合模型在形态相似状况的区分上表现更好。

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合的方法为自动化牙科诊断支持提供了实用路径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中出现的注意力泄漏问题，该问题源于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射错误

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更精确的语义对齐解决方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的加速框架，通过智能缓存中间特征来减少计算开销，在保持甚至提升视觉质量的同时实现2倍推理加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销大，简单的特征缓存会导致质量下降，需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题

Method: 提出ERTACache框架，包含离线残差分析识别可重用步骤、动态调整积分间隔的轨迹感知校正系数、以及通过闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中实现2倍推理加速，同时保持或提升视觉质量，在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上实现2倍加速且VBench指标下降最小

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统性地解决缓存误差问题，为扩散模型提供了高效且准确的加速方案，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理效率

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)任务，通过保留关键视频片段和重构查询来改进视频大语言模型的时序语义理解能力，在训练和推理阶段分别带来7.33%和34.6%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型由于稀疏帧采样和帧间推理监督不足，难以捕捉细粒度时序语义，而人类自然具备通过拖动进度条聚焦关键时间段的时序筛选能力。

Method: 提出TVS任务作为模块化前端适配器：1）保留焦点关键视频片段；2）同步重构查询为最直接形式同时保持答案一致性；3）保持答案的不变性和一致性。包含ReSimplifyIt基线方法。

Result: 在视频修剪任务上F-1分数比先前方法提升0.47，在查询重写任务上达到竞争性性能。TVS在训练阶段带来7.33%相对增益，在推理阶段带来34.6%相对增益。

Conclusion: TVS通过优化推理负担和认知负载分布，有效提升了视频语言理解能力，证明了时序信息筛选对改进视频大语言模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是手术工具定位的有效方法，通过发布数据集、基准模型和标注软件来促进该方法的采用。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一个即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，无需模型特定调整，在多种模型上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，且需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效的安全解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，将安全控制信号注入到锁定的T2I模型中，以补丁形式进行更新，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并。

Result: 在6个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降低到7%，而基准方法约为20%，同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control是一种有效的即插即用安全解决方案，显著优于现有外部和内部防御机制，适用于具有类似去噪架构的T2I模型。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [43] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思维的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启动思维过程，在保持高性能的同时减少计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会使用逐步思维过程，造成计算资源浪费，需要一种能够自适应决定是否启动思维的机制。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练，结合双模式策略优化(BPO)，首先在精心策划的数据集上训练模型，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行第二阶段训练，强制模型为每个输入生成两种模式的响应。

Result: 在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的16B模型性能相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制有效平衡了性能和效率，为多模态大语言模型的实际部署提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HiddenObject框架，通过Mamba-based融合机制整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，在遮挡、伪装等复杂条件下实现更鲁棒的多模态目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来解决隐藏或部分遮挡物体的检测挑战。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的融合机制整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合，适用于各种挑战性场景。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现了椎体级别的CT/X射线配准，在噪声X射线下表现出优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染和比较"方法存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声处理困难。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含基于学习的辐射高斯重建模块和反事实注意力学习机制，采用患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验显示，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过创新的联合重建和配准方法，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的准确性和实时性挑战，特别是在噪声环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要构建大规模合成数据集来推动相关研究。

Method: 创建包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义增强3D线框图、对应平面图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图派生，包含房间、门窗信息。

Result: 成功构建了SYNBUILD-3D数据集，提供了大规模、多样化、多模态的3D建筑数据，支持开发新型生成式AI算法来自动创建LoD 4级别的3D建筑模型。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D为自动化3D建筑模型生成提供了重要数据基础，其多模态特性支持开发在预定义平面布局和屋顶几何约束下保持语义-几何一致性的生成算法。数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的方法来同时估计单应性和径向畸变，解决了三种不同配置的径向畸变问题，并开发了快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实图像中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变（特别是径向畸变）会影响单应性估计的准确性。过去的方法需要分别处理三种不同的径向畸变配置，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：单图像畸变、两图像相同畸变和两图像独立畸变。基于该方法构建了新的最小求解器。

Result: 在所有三种情况下，提出的求解器都比现有最先进方法更快，同时保持了相似的精度。在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个统一的框架来解决带径向畸变的单应性估计问题，所开发的求解器在速度和精度方面都有显著改进，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决了跨层概念不一致问题，提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量(CAVs)在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的语义一致表示方法。

Method: 采用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，使用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的GCAV，并提出了TGCAV方法进行测试。

Result: 实验表明GCAV有效减少了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的深度学习模型概念编码理解框架。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，利用LLM从少量样本中推断语义身份规则，指导视觉基础模型提取身份敏感特征，实现对新类别的零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前ReID方法需要为每个新类别训练专用模型、缺乏泛化能力且标注成本高的问题，同时克服自监督学习难以捕获身份敏感特征的局限性。

Method: 结合LLM和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，生成动态视觉提示来指导VFM（如DINO）提取身份判别特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在新类别上明显优于基线方法，展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: VICP通过语义-视觉对齐实现了对新类别的零样本ReID，无需数据集特定的重新训练，为跨类别对象重识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，结果显示T1加权MRI任务DSC为0.56，T2加权MRI任务性能下降至DSC 0.33，表明小数据集和不同MRI序列对胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断、治疗规划和结果评估至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用Auto3DSeg架构中的SegResNet模型，采用5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，专注于解剖相关感兴趣区域。任务1使用91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI，任务2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac病例。

Result: 任务1：DSC 0.56，5 mm DSC 0.73，HD95 41.1 mm，MASD 26.0 mm，RMSE 5164 mm；任务2：DSC 0.33，5 mm DSC 0.50，HD95 20.1 mm，MASD 7.2 mm，RMSE 17203 mm。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了基于MRI的小数据集胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，不同MRI序列引入的变异性，尽管性能一般，但展示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过反推底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型在不同对比度图像上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型在不同成像序列间泛化能力差，主要原因是图像对比度差异大。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）决定，这为解决泛化问题提供了物理基础。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过解决非线性逆问题从观测图像反推底层自旋属性；2）使用扩散模型学习mSASHA数据集中的自旋属性先验分布；3）基于估计的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像中获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成。实验表明，Reverse Imaging能够在完全不同图像对比度和成像协议下实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用设计，依赖2D约束优化姿态但牺牲3D精度，无法同时考虑个性化体型和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 先校准用户体型，然后基于该体型进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器构建形状条件3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块增强现有3D姿态估计器性能。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦体型校准和姿态拟合过程，有效减少对2D约束的过度依赖，在数据效率和集成灵活性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真3D人体姿态方面表现出色，但其迭代性质和多重假设需求导致计算成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 采用分层时间剪枝(HTP)策略：1)时间相关性增强剪枝(TCEP)通过自适应时间图构建分析帧间运动相关性识别关键帧；2)稀疏聚焦时间多头注意力(SFT MHSA)利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3)掩码引导姿态令牌剪枝器(MGPTP)通过聚类进行细粒度语义剪枝

Conclusion: 提出的分层时间剪枝策略有效解决了扩散模型在3D人体姿态估计中的计算效率问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Print2Volume是一个从2D指纹图像生成逼真合成3D OCT指纹的框架，通过三个模块实现：2D风格转换、3D结构扩展和OCT真实性细化，解决了OCT数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能够获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模公共数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习算法的发展。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转换为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实性细化器添加真实纹理和噪声。

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本的大规模数据集，通过在合成数据上预训练并在小规模真实数据上微调，将ZJUT-EIFD基准的等错误率从15.62%显著降低到2.50%。

Conclusion: Print2Volume框架有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，显著提升了识别性能，为深度学习模型提供了充足训练数据。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 妇科腹腔镜手术视频的人工分析耗时费力，而计算机视觉和机器学习方法需要大量样本数据，但医学领域数据稀缺

Method: 与领先医学专家合作创建包含子宫内膜异位症区域标注的图像数据集

Result: 成功发布了首个此类数据集GLENDA，为子宫内膜异位症的计算机辅助诊断提供数据支持

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集填补了妇科腹腔镜领域数据空白，将促进计算机视觉在手术视频分析中的应用

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用区域全卷积网络在腹腔镜妇科手术视频中进行手术器械实例分割和识别的性能，结果显示器械分割准确率较高，但器械类型识别仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息源，但自动内容索引（基于内容搜索的基础）仍面临巨大挑战，因为视频内容特殊。

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的(1)器械分割（二值分割）和(2)器械识别（多类别识别），在腹腔镜妇科手术视频上进行评估。

Result: 即使训练样本数量适中，也能以相当高的准确率定位和分割器械区域；但确定具体器械类型仍然非常困难，因为手术器械本身相似度很高。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割技术已经相对成熟，但器械类型识别由于器械间高度相似性仍然是该领域的主要挑战。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,
where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we
investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for
pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored

on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.

components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.

TL;DR: 提出一种用于生物全手片图像(WSI)的索引地图和基于领域的配置机制，通过三层组织结构提供细粒度的组织地图信息，解决大规模WSI集合中手动检查效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整片WSI图像在AI算法开发中重要，但缺乏标准元数据标准，大规模集合中手动检查效率低下，需要自动化方案来描述图像内容。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，生成WSI的2D索引地图，并针对特定应用领域设计配置机制。组织为三层结构：来源层、组织类型层和病理改变层，每个层都将WSI区域分配到特定类别。

Result: 在临床病理学领域进行了实践验证，使用通用语法和语义实现不同目录之间的互操性，并通过WSI目录、机器学习和图象表示等应用场景展示了其优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为WSI集合提供了详细的组织地图，有效解决了大规模集合中手动检查效率低的问题，为AI算法开发提供了标准化的元数据支持。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，需要模型能够增量学习。现有的类增量学习方法假设增量数据集完全标注，这在实践中不现实。

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种类增量学习方法中，通过置信度选择机制从未标注数据中学习。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，相比有监督方法取得竞争性结果，在最终准确率上比最先进的类增量新类别发现方法高出5%以上。

Conclusion: ICPL方法能够有效解决无标注数据的增量学习问题，在细粒度数据集上展示了实际应用价值，计算复杂度验证了其在资源受限环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管模型规模比基于扩散的方法小，MedShift表现出强大的性能，在推理时保持灵活性，可以调整以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学成像中的领域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有全球产品主要关注二元树冠覆盖或冠层高度，无法在个体水平上识别树木，大尺度个体树木监测存在建模不足的问题。

Method: 使用深度学习方法和3米分辨率PlanetScope影像，通过高斯核模拟可扩展大小的树冠，从机载激光雷达数据自动提取数十亿个点进行训练。

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能实现高保真实时渲染，但在动态场景扩展时面临高斯数据量大和训练时间长的限制，需要更高效的训练框架。

Method: 采用基于锚点的分层高斯组织结构，粗粒度高斯表示场景低分辨率结构，细粒度高斯负责细节渲染；引入混合变形和生成策略处理帧间运动；使用双向自适应掩码机制去除静态区域并优先处理信息丰富的视角。

Result: 大量实验表明，M框架在显著减少训练时间的同时，实现了优于现有方法的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态场景的高斯泼溅提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，在训练效率和渲染质量方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备上部署图像描述应用。需要开发轻量级但性能相当的专用模型。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，并通过Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架增强视觉定位能力，使用DeepLens提取详细信息表示。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架通过改进视觉定位有效解决了语义描述错误问题。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术家族或在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽略了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 提出MME评分方法，统一了最先进的OOD检测器，结合特征截断技术和多种评分函数的聚合。

Result: 在大规模和小规模基准测试中，MME在所有基准上都显著优于现有最先进方法，在ImageNet-1K基准上FPR95达到27.57%，比最佳基线提升6%。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实证证明，特征截断和评分函数的有效组合以及多评分函数聚合能够显著增强OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了从单词级到行级OCR的转变，绕过单词分割错误，利用更大语境上下文来提高识别准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，而现代字符序列方法将粒度从字符提升到单词后，识别精度的瓶颈又转移到了单词分割。需要找到更好的解决方案。

Method: 提出行级OCR方法，直接将整行图像作为输入，输出字符序列。这样可以避免单词分割错误，并为语言模型提供更大的句子上下文。还构建了包含251张英语页面图像的行级注释数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示端到端准确性提高5.4%，效率提高了4倍。这证明了向行级OCR转变的潜在优势。

Conclusion: 行级OCR方法在准确性和效率方面都显著优于传统单词级方法，特别适用于文档图像处理。随着大语言模型的发展，这种方法还有更大的潜力。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Motivation: 现有基于数据变换的方法在增强对抗样本迁移性时，过度增强图像背景或无关区域会引入干扰，导致目标检测模型误检，这些错误并非由对抗补丁本身引起

Method: 局部增强方法，仅对目标区域应用增强，避免影响非目标区域，使损失函数更直接关注对抗补丁对检测模型的影响

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率并增强了迁移性

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提升对抗补丁攻击的效果和迁移能力

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个专门针对长视频幻觉问题的基准测试ELV-Halluc，发现并系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)现象，提出了位置编码和DPO策略来缓解SAH，在基准测试上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频内容不一致或无关的幻觉。此前的研究主要关注短视频，对长视频中由于语义复杂性增加而产生的语义聚合幻觉(SAH)研究不足。

Method: 1) 构建ELV-Halluc基准测试系统研究长视频幻觉；2) 分析SAH现象及其与语义复杂度的关系；3) 采用位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH；4) 构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，并发现其随语义复杂度增加而增加；模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH；采用提出的方法后，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比率大幅降低27.7%。

Conclusion: 长视频中的语义聚合幻觉是一个重要但被忽视的问题，需要专门的研究和解决方案。提出的位置编码和DPO策略能有效缓解SAH，为改善视频多模态模型的幻觉问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

*Ronan Docherty,Antonis Vamvakeros,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种卷积神经网络上采样器，将低分辨率基础模型特征与输入图像结合进行上采样，用于高效处理显微图像分割任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于patch的基础模型特征在处理显微图像时存在两个问题：1）难以表示显微图像中的精细特征；2）难以处理材料和生物图像分析中的大尺寸图像

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微图像的特征化和分割

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割使用这些深度特征能够以更少的标签和更快的速度产生高质量分割结果

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了显微图像分割的效率和准确性，特别是在处理精细特征和大尺寸图像方面表现出色

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

*Hao Ruan,Jinliang Lin,Yingxin Lai,Zhiming Luo,Shaozi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HCCM框架，通过区域-全局图像文本对比学习和匹配学习，解决无人机场景中视觉语言理解的细粒度语义和动态环境挑战，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机场景中的宽视场和复杂组合语义对视觉语言理解构成挑战，现有方法缺乏细粒度语义且依赖精确场景划分，在动态环境中效果有限。

Method: HCCM框架包含两个组件：(1)区域-全局图像文本对比学习(RG-ITC)，避免精确场景划分，通过局部视觉区域与全局文本的对比捕获层次化语义；(2)区域-全局图像文本匹配(RG-ITM)，评估全局跨模态表示中的局部语义一致性，增强组合推理。还引入动量对比和蒸馏机制提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在GeoText-1652数据集上达到28.8%的图像检索Recall@1和14.7%的文本检索Recall@1。在未见过的ERA数据集上实现39.93%的平均召回率，优于微调基线。

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，通过层次化跨粒度对比和匹配学习实现了优异的性能和零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于潜在扩散模型的单图像3D高斯溅射场景重建方法，能够从单张图像生成完整3D场景（包括遮挡部分），解决了传统方法在遮挡区域重建中的模糊性和单一性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯溅射方法需要密集观测且无法重建遮挡和未观测区域，回归方法只能预测单一模式导致模糊和不合理结果，需要生成式方法来解决遮挡表面的多可能性问题

Method: 使用变分自重构器从2D图像自监督学习潜在空间，然后在该潜在空间上训练扩散模型，以单张图像为条件生成3D高斯溅射表示

Result: 方法能够生成忠实重建结果和多样化样本，能够完成遮挡表面重建，实现高质量的360度渲染

Conclusion: 提出的生成式方法成功解决了单图像3D场景重建中的遮挡问题，通过自监督学习潜在空间和扩散模型实现了高质量的多模态场景补全

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EZ-Sort通过CLIP模型预排序和自动化比较，将成对比较的标注成本从O(n²)降低到接近O(n log n)，在保持可靠性的同时减少90.5%的人工标注量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成对比较在主观标注任务中更可靠，但完全比较需要O(n²)次标注，计算成本过高。现有方法虽已减少到O(n log n)，但仍需进一步优化标注效率

Method: 1) 使用CLIP模型进行零样本分层预排序；2) 初始化桶感知Elo评分；3) 运行不确定性引导的人机协同归并排序，用自动化比较替代明显的人类比较

Result: 在多个数据集上验证：人脸年龄估计减少90.5%人工标注，比现有方法减少19.8%（n=100时），同时保持或提高了评分者间可靠性

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，显著降低了人工标注成本

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备普及，从第一人称视角建模人-物交互是一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题，需要从最小化观察（仅头部和手腕跟踪）中恢复交互信息。

Method: 使用扩散Transformer架构和三元扩散过程联合建模人体运动、物体轨迹和接触序列；在头部中心规范空间中操作增强鲁棒性；采用基于传送带的推理方法处理任意长度序列。

Result: 通过广泛评估，ECHO在自我中心人-物交互重建方面超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出了从最小观察中统一恢复人-物交互多种模态的框架，展现了卓越的灵活性和重建能力，为可穿戴设备应用提供了重要技术基础。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在通用场景预训练后，在城市场景中的细粒度空间推理能力转移效果尚不明确，需要系统评估和提升。

Method: 使用BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三种模型，构建基于街景图像分割、深度和物体检测预测的合成VQA数据集，并配以LLM生成的思维链答案进行微调。

Result: 零样本设置下模型表现尚可，但使用合成思维链监督数据集微调后性能大幅提升，特别是在否定和反事实等挑战性问题类型上。

Conclusion: 城市场景空间推理是视觉语言模型的新挑战，合成数据集构建是通用模型适应专业领域的实用路径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习时间分布并支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法要么只考虑单一时间上下文，要么专注于分类或回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测，且现有方法往往局限于单时间点、特定疾病或有其他技术限制。

Method: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，这是一种生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特殊情况。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健的基线。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学成像中时间动态建模的重要空白，提供了一种统一的生成式方法，能够有效处理4D医学图像预测任务，并在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个多模态深度学习框架，整合术前CT和术后病理切片图像来预测肾透明细胞癌的复发风险，发现病理信息具有最强的预后价值，中间融合策略能进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leibovich评分系统在肾透明细胞癌复发风险分层中应用广泛，但存在患者层面分辨率有限且缺乏影像信息的局限性，需要开发更精准的多模态预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，使用预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合三种设置，整合术前CT和术后病理全切片图像。

Result: 病理图像模型始终优于CT模型，中间融合进一步改善性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。放射学通过融合增加价值，但病理学显示出更强的预后能力。

Conclusion: 证明了基于基础模型的多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中的可行性，未来需要探索更具表现力的融合策略、更大的多模态数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在计算机生成全息术中的三个主要问题：端到端网络忽视物理关系、CNN方法感受野有限、ASM方法局限于有限近场

Method: 使用深度展开网络将梯度下降分解为两个模块：自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复值去噪器(PCD)，其中PCD采用复值可变形自注意力模块捕获全局特征

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上实现了最先进的性能，PSNR超过35dB，相比ASM方法具有更宽的工作距离

Conclusion: 提出的DUN方法在保持物理关系解释性的同时，有效解决了CGH中的非线性不适定问题，实现了优异的重建性能

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 全身PET/CT成像中病灶分割面临示踪剂异质性、生理性摄取和多中心变异性的挑战，需要保持人类在环的高效交互式分割方法。

Method: 扩展nnU-Net框架，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道，系统研究空间提示表示方法，提出欧几里得距离变换编码和在线用户交互模拟策略。

Conclusion: 可提示模型在PET/CT交互式分割中具有重要价值，欧几里得距离变换编码优于高斯核方法，为临床工作流程提供了有效的用户引导分割解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用基于注意力的标准映射技术，存在泛化问题，经常产生不存在的道路元素幻觉，需要更准确的几何映射方法。

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，提出概率投影机制和置信度评分系统，用于细化映射对齐场景并过滤无关元素，同时使用时序置信度选择性地累积可靠信息。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上实验显示，性能优于最先进方法，泛化能力更好，特别是在nuScenes和长感知距离挑战场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制通过置信度引导的几何映射和时序处理，显著提高了HD地图构建的准确性和泛化能力，特别是在复杂场景中效果明显。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

*Amirhossein Nazeri,Wael Hafez*

TL;DR: 研究发现CNN激活熵可用于检测对抗性攻击，无需修改模型即可实现90%检测准确率，假阳性和假阴性率低于20%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击检测方法需要重新训练、修改网络架构或降低干净输入的性能表现，需要一种无需模型修改的实时检测方案

Method: 通过在VGG-16上并行监测激活熵，发现对抗性扰动在早期卷积层产生可检测的熵特征变化

Result: 对抗性输入使激活熵偏移7%，检测准确率达90%，假阳性和假阴性率均低于20%，干净和对抗性输入的熵分布完全分离

Conclusion: CNN可靠性可通过激活熵单独评估，实现了无需影响原始模型性能的实时自诊断视觉系统部署

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

*João Valente,Atabak Dehban,Rodrigo Ventura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAD2DMD-SET是一个合成数据生成工具，通过3D CAD模型和高级渲染技术生成数字测量设备(DMD)的视觉问答数据集，显著提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂真实场景中的读数能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在数字测量设备读数任务中表现不佳，特别是在存在遮挡、极端视角、运动模糊等真实场景条件下。需要专门的数据集来提升模型在这些挑战性环境中的性能。

Method: 利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染和高保真图像合成技术生成多样化的合成DMD数据集，同时创建了包含1000张真实标注图像的验证集DMDBench。使用ANLS指标评估模型性能，并通过LoRA微调方法优化模型。

Result: 使用CAD2DMD-SET生成的数据集微调后，InternVL模型性能提升了200%，且在其他任务上没有性能下降，显著增强了模型在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性和表现。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET工具能够有效提升LVLMs在数字测量设备读数任务中的性能，该工具将开源发布，支持社区添加不同测量设备并生成自定义数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了SSL-SaN自监督模型，通过引入静音和噪声训练策略，在视觉声源定位任务中实现了更好的正例性能和负例鲁棒性，并提出了新的评估指标和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉声源定位方法在低音频-视觉语义对应场景（如静音、噪声、屏幕外声音）表现不佳，且现有评估主要局限于正例场景，缺乏对负例音频的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 提出包含静音和噪声的新训练策略，开发自监督模型SSL-SaN；提出新的评估指标量化正负音频-视觉对的特征对齐和分离性；扩展IS3合成数据集为IS3+，包含负例音频。

Result: SSL-SaN模型在声源定位和跨模态检索任务中达到了最先进的性能，在正例情况下表现更好，同时对负例声音更加鲁棒。

Conclusion: 通过引入负例音频训练和新的评估框架，显著提升了视觉声源定位系统在真实场景中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Motivation: GUI智能体是实现自动化设备操作的重要任务，但面临操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足以及基础模型能力有限等挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调处理各种GUI场景的感知和规划任务，开发课程强化学习框架支持复杂推理和在线环境探索，并收集超过100万步操作轨迹数据。

Conclusion: UItron通过系统性数据工程和交互基础设施，推动了GUI智能体向实际应用迈进一步，解决了现有解决方案在中文能力方面的普遍不足。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLIP-DCA方法，通过增强域感知表示和分离分类来解决CLIP在域泛化评估中的性能下降问题，在更具挑战性的OOD数据集上表现显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为网络规模的预训练数据可能已经覆盖了许多基准测试。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能

Method: CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的域感知表示；2）通过合成生成多样化域数据；3）鼓励从域特征中解耦实现域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA在更具挑战性的评估中相比现有方法显示出显著改进，特别是在更OOD的数据集上表现更好

Conclusion: 增强域感知是基础模型中实现有效域不变分类的前提条件，通过解耦域感知表示和分类可以显著提升CLIP在域泛化任务中的性能

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

TL;DR: 本文研究非典型视频数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别任务中带来性能提升，特别是语义多样性对模型泛化能力有重要帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中面对罕见新概念时表现出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。本文旨在探索非典型视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型视频数据（如科幻、动画等）的新数据集，将其用于模型训练过程中的表示学习，并在三个关键任务上进行评估：OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别。

Result: 实验表明，使用非典型数据的简单学习方法在所有设置中都能持续提升性能。增加非典型样本的类别多样性可进一步提升OOD检测性能；在新类别发现任务中，使用更小但语义更多样化的非典型样本集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性有助于模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集和发现鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注有监督持续学习，需要标签和任务边界信息，但标注数据成本高且不实用。视频数据具有丰富的时空信息，但在无监督持续学习领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用无监督视频transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，采用核密度估计(KDE)作为数据的非参数概率表示。引入新颖性检测标准动态扩展记忆簇，并利用先前任务的迁移学习作为初始状态。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行了深入评估，不使用任何标签或类别边界，证明该方法在连续学习多个任务时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督视频持续学习方法有效解决了视频数据处理的计算和内存需求挑战，为非参数学习提供了可行的解决方案，在无标签条件下实现了良好的连续学习效果。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务背景下开发专业化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出色，在多项选择题测试中准确率达到92.8%，优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也获得较高评分，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5在临床决策支持，特别是放射肿瘤学领域的性能表现，验证其作为临床辅助工具的可行性。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤学病例。由四位认证放射肿瘤学家评估治疗建议的正确性、全面性和幻觉情况。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于前代模型。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但生成的建议仍需专家严格监督，不能完全替代临床判断，特别是在复杂场景中。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。

Method: 通过在现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）上使用伪对象描述进行标注，利用带真实掩码的视频预处理突出感兴趣对象，并馈送到大型视觉语言模型（VLM）来生成标注。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。需要测试模型在罕见边缘案例中的表现，以模拟真实的驾驶知识考试。

Method: 开发了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉模态，涵盖交通法规和场景。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调实验，分析模型对环境因素（光照、视角、距离、天气）的敏感性。

Result: 1）现有模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2）在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面；3）预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能，在nuScenes和BDD等真实数据集上取得更好结果。

Conclusion: DriveQA是一个有效的基准测试工具，能够识别多模态模型在驾驶知识方面的局限性，通过针对性的训练可以显著提升模型性能，并证明模型能够内化文本和合成交通知识来有效泛化到下游QA任务。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.
