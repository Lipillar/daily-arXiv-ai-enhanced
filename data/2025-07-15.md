### [1] [Spatial ModernBERT: Spatial-Aware Transformer for Table and Key-Value Extraction in Financial Documents at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08865)
*Javis AI Team,Amrendra Singh,Maulik Shah,Dharshan Sampath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spatial ModernBERT模型通过空间嵌入增强，用于从复杂财务文档中提取表格和键值对，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 财务文档中的表格和键值对提取对审计、数据分析和自动化发票处理等业务流程至关重要。

Method: 模型采用三头分类任务（标签、列、行），预训练于PubTables-1M数据集，并通过后处理方法重构表格布局。

Result: 实验表明，模型结合文本和空间信息，实现了高精度的表格和键值对提取。

Conclusion: Spatial ModernBERT在财务文档处理中表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential
for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice
processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based
model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract
tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the
extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,
classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,
Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;
(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model
is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial
document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on
each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens
using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value
pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages
both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value
extraction in real-world financial documents.

### [2] [SEALGuard: Safeguarding the Multilingual Conversations in Southeast Asian Languages for LLM Software Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08898)
*Wenliang Shan,Michael Fu,Rui Yang,Chakkrit,Tantithamthavorn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEALGuard是一种多语言护栏，旨在提升LLM系统在多语言环境中的安全对齐能力，显著优于现有方法如LlamaGuard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏（如LlamaGuard）在多语言不安全输入（尤其是低资源语言）上表现不佳，导致LLM系统易受攻击。

Method: 通过低秩适应（LoRA）将通用多语言模型转化为多语言护栏，并构建SEALSBench数据集（包含26万条多语言提示）。

Result: SEALGuard在多语言不安全提示检测中表现优异，防御成功率（DSR）比LlamaGuard提升48%，且各项指标最佳。

Conclusion: SEALGuard通过有效多语言护栏显著提升了LLM系统的安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of
LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了当前大语言模型（LLM）在医学问答中的局限性，重点关注评估数据集的质量，并提出标准化框架的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在医学问答中的表现，发现现有数据集的不足，如缺乏临床真实性和透明度。

Method: 回顾了MedQA等常用基准数据集，并分析了医学期刊挑战问题的潜力。

Result: 现有数据集普遍缺乏临床现实性和验证，挑战问题虽有益但规模小且范围窄。

Conclusion: 需建立标准化评估框架，并通过多方合作确保数据集的严谨性和代表性。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models
(LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used
for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets,
including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor,
transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as
challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their
potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack
clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly
available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their
small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight
the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A
standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine.
Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure
datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical
complexities.

that encompass not only academic domains but also industrial fields to
effectively evaluate their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce two Korean expert-level benchmarks. KMMLU-Redux,
reconstructed from the existing KMMLU, consists of questions from the Korean
National Technical Qualification exams, with critical errors removed to enhance
reliability. KMMLU-Pro is based on Korean National Professional Licensure exams
to reflect professional knowledge in Korea. Our experiments demonstrate that
these benchmarks comprehensively represent industrial knowledge in Korea. We
release our dataset publicly available.

### [5] [Self-Improving Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08967)
*Rongyi Zhu,Yuhui Wang,Tanqiu Jiang,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIMS是一种无需外部监督的自改进模型引导框架，通过自主生成和优化对比样本，提升大型语言模型（LLM）的适应性和引导效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型引导方法依赖外部标注数据，限制了其适应性和效果。SIMS旨在通过自改进框架解决这一问题。

Method: SIMS通过迭代自改进循环生成和优化对比样本，并结合提示排序和对比采样等策略增强引导效果。

Result: 在多种LLM和基准测试中，SIMS显著优于现有方法，展现了更高的引导效果和适应性。

Conclusion: 自改进模型引导是未来LLM推理对齐研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large
language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However,
conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data,
not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering
their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the
first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on
external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines
contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling
adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel
strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance
steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks
demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering
effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a
promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

### [6] [Application of CARE-SD text classifier tools to assess distribution of stigmatizing and doubt-marking language features in EHR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08969)
*Drew Walker,Jennifer Love,Swati Rajwal,Isabel C Walker,Hannah LF Cooper,Abeed Sarker,Melvin Livingston III*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现电子健康记录中存在对特定患者群体的污名化语言，尤其是黑人、低收入患者及某些疾病患者，且不同医疗提供者表现出类似模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）是患者污名化的重要媒介，研究旨在揭示其语言特征及影响因素。

Method: 通过扩展词典匹配和监督学习分类器识别MIMIC-III EHR中的怀疑标记和污名化标签，并使用泊松回归模型评估预测因素。

Result: 黑人、低收入患者及某些疾病患者的污名化标签率更高，护士和社会工作者的使用率也较高。

Conclusion: 污名化语言在历史上被污名化的患者中更常见，需采取措施减少此类现象。

Abstract: Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through
which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We
identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in
MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning
classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using
Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing
labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16),
patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46),
self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and
mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though
male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased
stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),
with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language
occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated
by multiple provider types.

### [7] [Beyond vividness: Content analysis of induced hallucinations reveals the hidden structure of individual differences in visual imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09011)
*Ana Chkhaidze,Reshanne R. Reeder,Connor Gag,Anastasia Kiyonaga,Seana Coulson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉与个体视觉表象能力的关联，发现表象能力强的个体描述更复杂的幻觉内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉表象能力（从无表象到生动表象）如何影响Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉内容。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具分析4000多名参与者的幻觉自由文本描述，比较不同表象能力个体的描述差异。

Result: 表象能力强的个体描述复杂自然内容，能力弱的个体描述简单几何图案；视觉语言模型能更好捕捉这些差异。

Conclusion: 结果可能反映早期视觉区与高阶区协调的个体差异，与表象能力谱相关。

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.

### [8] [Lizard: An Efficient Linearization Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09025)
*Chien Van Nguyen,Ruiyi Zhang,Hanieh Deilamsalehy,Puneet Mathur,Viet Dac Lai,Haoliang Wang,Jayakumar Subramanian,Ryan A. Rossi,Trung Bui,Nikos Vlassis,Franck Dernoncourt,Thien Huu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lizard是一种线性化框架，将预训练的Transformer LLMs转化为支持无限上下文生成的次二次复杂度架构，解决了内存和计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer LLMs因softmax注意力的二次复杂性和KV缓存增长，面临上下文长度增加时的性能瓶颈。

Method: Lizard引入次二次注意力机制，结合门控模块和混合注意力机制（全局压缩与局部滑动窗口），并优化硬件感知训练算法。

Result: 实验显示Lizard在语言建模任务中几乎无损恢复教师模型性能，在MMLU基准上提升18分，并在关联召回任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Lizard通过灵活的门控和混合注意力机制，显著提升了线性化方法的性能和适应性。

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic
architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face
significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,
due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value
(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic
attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while
preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are
often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating
mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent
state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports
constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more
flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global
context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,
forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and
fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware
algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive
experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher
model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while
significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU
benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant
improvements on associative recall tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALIGN系统通过动态个性化方法，将大型语言模型（LLM）与用户多样化的价值观和偏好对齐，支持决策辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM比较工具主要关注基准测试任务，而忽视了用户多样化的价值观和偏好对决策的影响。

Method: ALIGN系统采用基于提示的对齐方法，结合配置管理、结构化输出生成和可替换的LLM算法实现。

Result: 系统支持定性和定量分析，在公共意见调查和医疗分诊决策中验证了不同对齐方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ALIGN框架开源，为可靠、负责任和个性化的LLM决策辅助研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids.
However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their
decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and
personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking
tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed
ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers
through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key
features of our system include robust configuration management, structured
output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with
swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user
interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their
alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm
integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing
alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public
opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The
entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable,
responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenCodeReasoning-II是一个包含250万问题-解决方案-评论三元组的数据集，用于代码生成和评论的联合训练，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成和评论领域缺乏大规模高质量数据集，限制了LLM的发展。

Method: 采用两阶段监督微调策略，首阶段专注于代码生成，次阶段联合训练生成和评论模型。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5-Instruct模型在代码生成上表现优异，结合评论模型后显著提升竞赛编程性能。

Conclusion: OpenCodeReasoning-II和联合训练策略为代码推理任务提供了有效解决方案，并扩展了LiveCodeBench以支持C++评估。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created
significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique.
However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a
dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique
programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest
publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage
supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for
code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models
for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct
models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the
best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code
generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive
coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench
benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby
facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

### [11] [Dynamic Parameter Memory: Temporary LoRA-Enhanced LLM for Long-Sequence Emotion Recognition in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09076)
*Jialong Mai,Xiaofen Xing,Yawei Li,Zhipeng Li,Jingyuan Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态参数记忆（DPM）机制，用于解决语音大语言模型（SLLM）在长音频序列情感识别中的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音模态的高帧率限制了SLLM的信号处理能力，现有方法忽视了情感在对话中的连续性和惯性。

Method: 提出DPM机制，通过上下文语义和句子级情感编码，结合临时LoRA模块，实现无限长度音频处理。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，DPM显著提升了SLLM的长音频情感识别能力，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DPM机制有效扩展了SLLM在长音频情感识别中的应用，解决了上下文窗口限制问题。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to
improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame
rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding
capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only
process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its
capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the
continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This
paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual
semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of
unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM
progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary
LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual
information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM
into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental
results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion
recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences,
achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评判模型存在专业性强、鲁棒性差的问题，限制了其全面评估能力。

Method: 采用任务驱动的多领域数据策略，结合可验证奖励和监督学习，引入边界策略梯度损失优化学习目标。

Result: CompassJudger-2在多个评判和奖励基准测试中表现优异，7B模型与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了LLM评判的鲁棒性和可扩展性，并建立了新的性能与评估标准。

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has
gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow
specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for
comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel
generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,
multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising
judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning
through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment
capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy
gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves
superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model
demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models
like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank
consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance
robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation
standards.

TL;DR: OPENXRD是一个开放书籍的X射线衍射问答系统，利用GPT-4.5生成简洁的参考资料，帮助小模型理解XRD概念，显著提升回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统使用扫描教材带来的版权问题，同时填补小模型在晶体学领域的知识空白。

Method: 通过GPT-4.5生成紧凑的领域特定参考资料，结合不同视觉语言模型（如GPT-4、LLaVA等）在开放和封闭书籍条件下进行测试。

Result: 使用GPT-4.5生成摘要的模型在晶体学问题上表现出显著准确性提升，尤其是训练数据有限的模型。

Conclusion: OPENXRD展示了开放书籍系统在材料科学中的潜力，为科学领域的NLP工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for
crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with
concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned
textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact,
domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217
expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,
including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,
under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with
supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant
accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,
particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses
knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and
shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively
in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based
inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams
or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials
science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can
be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural
language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模型PU-Lie，结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释特征和PU学习目标，用于检测战略对话中的欺骗行为，在极端类别不平衡情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略对话中欺骗检测的复杂性和高风险性，以及类别极端不平衡（欺骗信息仅占5%）的挑战。

Method: 结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释的语言和游戏特定特征，采用PU学习目标，专注于少数标注的欺骗信息。

Result: 模型在宏观F1得分上达到0.60，同时减少了650倍以上的可训练参数。

Conclusion: PU学习、语言可解释性和说话者感知表示在欺骗检测中具有重要价值，尤其在优先检测欺骗信息的情况下。

Abstract: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task
due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive
and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in
the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We
introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings,
interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is
tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are
labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1
of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive
evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value
of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations.
Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting
deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority
guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital
deceptive class.

Result: 实验表明RAMA在基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在处理模糊或不可信信息时。

Conclusion: 整合网络证据和多代理推理对可信的多媒体验证至关重要，RAMA为更可靠的事实核查提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal misinformation presents significant
challenges for automated fact-checking systems, especially when claims are
ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel
retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia
misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query
formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries;
(2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative
sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the
complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt
variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior
performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving
ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual
evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based
evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA
will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.

Method: 使用集成梯度识别并剪枝与数据集特定机制相关的神经元。

Result: 在多选题基准测试中，剪枝微调显著提升性能，优于非剪枝方法。

Conclusion: 剪枝微调能有效增强模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to
specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which
yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While
beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade
performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work,
we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by
identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in
transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify
each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that
disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without
supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons
compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across
multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly
enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 藏语作为低资源语言，在现有模型中代表性不足，缺乏高质量训练语料。

Method: 构建了最大的藏语预训练语料库，采用专用数据处理流程，并在多语言基础模型上进行预训练和微调。

Result: Banzhida模型在多项任务中显著优于同类开源模型和专为藏语设计的模型。

Conclusion: Banzhida模型为藏语生成AI提供了重要进展，填补了低资源语言的空白。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many
languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is
particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of
high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest
Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and
applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for
Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual
base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances
generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model,
we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with
existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida
consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar
scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

TL;DR: 研究分析了视觉隐喻（如融化的冰川表现为融化的冰手榴弹）在气候变化传播中的效果，发现其虽增加认知负荷，但能引发更深层次的认知和抽象思考。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨视觉隐喻在气候变化传播中的效果，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 创建MetaClimage数据库，收集人类评分（难度、效能、艺术质量、情感唤起等），并通过自然语言处理分析标签。

Result: 视觉隐喻更难理解但更美观，效能和情感唤起与字面图像无差异；高认知需求者对情感唤起更高。视觉隐喻引发更多标签和更积极的情绪。

Conclusion: 视觉隐喻虽增加认知负荷，但能促进更深层次的认知和积极体验，为环境传播提供权衡参考。

Abstract: Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a
melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the
complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined
their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.
Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images
(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal
images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of
difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human
rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the
message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via
Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to
understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not
differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was
higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual
metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the
image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than
literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual
metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper
cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,
while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem
to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced
experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of
visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future
research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when
shaping environmental communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在幽默翻译中存在语言干扰和缺乏幽默感的问题，需要改进以促进跨文化理解与交流。

Method: 采用幽默分解机制（HDM），结合思维链（CoT）模拟人类思维过程，并融入幽默理论以增强翻译文本的幽默元素。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在幽默、流畅性和连贯性上分别平均提升了7.75%、2.81%和6.13%。

Conclusion: HDM有效提升了幽默翻译的质量，为跨文化交流提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,
fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models
still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through
linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,
we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that
utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought
process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous
texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the
humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments
on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in
humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

Conclusion: ClaritySpeech在低数据环境下有效提升痴呆症患者的语音可懂度和隐私保护。

Abstract: Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating
communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech
technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with
dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper
presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech,
integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to
correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data
environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1
score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion)
for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We
also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15
for ADReSSo) and speech quality from 1.65 to ~2.15, enhancing privacy and

Method: 引入DATE-LM基准，通过训练数据选择、毒性/偏见过滤和事实归因三个任务评估归因方法。

Result: 发现现有方法在不同任务中表现不一，无单一方法全面占优，且性能受任务设计影响。

Conclusion: DATE-LM为未来LLM数据归因研究提供了基础，并发布了公开排行榜以促进社区参与。

Abstract: Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model
outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research
and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data
valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric
evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data
Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating
data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures
attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection,
toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for
ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations
across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to
conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our
findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data
attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method
performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we
release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate
community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data
attribution research in LLMs.

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for
clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification
of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing
structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100
for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained

achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%,
precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from
71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in
interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical
observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model
research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language
processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across
diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at

Method: 提出M2SaG数据集（4970样本）和ViSP框架，结合PPO和对比学习优化生成。

Result: ViSP在五个指标上超越基线模型，生成文本的讽刺分数（0.898 vs. 0.770）和事实不一致性（0.768 vs. 0.739）更高。

Conclusion: ViSP在多模态讽刺生成中表现优异，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form.
Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored,
primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of
visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent
in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm
generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic
text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation
framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive
learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of
sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor
outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation
quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate
ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including
large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.
Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual
Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts
exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity
(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic
content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Our dataset and code will be released at

Result: 在英文ABSA基准数据集上，该方法优于现有基线及多数研究，表现出色。

Conclusion: 结合LLM的数据增强与强化学习优化能有效提升ABSA任务性能，解决了数据不足与不平衡问题。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in
social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect
terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language
models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding
capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in
the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced
labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.
Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual
information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but
faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this
paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data
augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training
data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training
data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA
model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation.
LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for
ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance
is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单用途AI系统缺乏协调性和记忆复用能力，难以应对复杂动态任务。

Result: 在复杂任务编排基准测试中表现优于基线框架，适应性、协调性和经验复用能力更强。

Conclusion: GoalfyMax为多智能体系统提供了可扩展的未来解决方案。

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling
complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and
adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack
sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities,
limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges,
we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end
multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant
interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered
memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces,
enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our
system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue,
long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting
robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task
orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves
superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline
frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready
foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a
crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific
parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this
paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models
(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing
capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the
indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual
relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on
the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic
scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs
reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among
advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we
conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format
adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several
key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github.

Result: 提示质量显著影响翻译性能，字符级和混合噪声对性能影响更大；模型在随机噪声下仍能翻译。

Conclusion: 提示质量主要影响指令遵循而非翻译质量本身，LLM在极端噪声下仍具翻译能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine
translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and
perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly
plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two
related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We
provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the
models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many
errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without
errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,
with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than
phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality
largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting
translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with
overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

### [32] [NMIXX: Domain-Adapted Neural Embeddings for Cross-Lingual eXploration of Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09601)
*Hanwool Lee,Sara Yu,Yewon Hwang,Jonghyun Choi,Heejae Ahn,Sungbum Jung,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NMIXX是一种针对金融领域的跨语言嵌入模型，通过微调高置信度三元组提升金融语义捕捉能力，并在韩英双语任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用句子嵌入模型难以捕捉金融领域的专业语义，尤其是在低资源语言（如韩语）中，存在领域术语、时间语义变化和双语词汇不对齐等问题。

Method: 引入NMIXX模型，通过18.8K高置信度三元组（包括领域内释义、语义偏移负样本和精确韩英翻译）进行微调，并发布KorFinSTS基准数据集。

Result: NMIXX在英语FinSTS和韩语KorFinSTS上分别取得+0.10和+0.22的Spearman's rho提升，优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: NMIXX和KorFinSTS为金融领域的多语言表示学习提供了有效工具，同时强调了分词设计在低资源跨语言环境中的重要性。

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture
specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like
Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned
bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural
eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual
embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair
in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology,
and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a
1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research
reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks
miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual
bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and
+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing
other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in
general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer
Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of
tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models
and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust
tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

*Salvatore Citraro,Edith Haim,Alessandra Carini,Cynthia S. Q. Siew,Giulio Rossetti,Massimo Stella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpreadPy是一个Python库，用于模拟认知单层和多层网络中的激活扩散，支持结构-功能关系的数值模拟研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认知、心理和临床现象中激活动态如何反映网络结构，提供工具支持系统化研究。

Method: 通过数值模拟和案例研究（如数学焦虑、创造力任务和失语症患者）验证工具的有效性。

Result: SpreadPy能区分不同认知状态（如高/低数学焦虑）、揭示任务难度对激活轨迹的影响，并关联临床错误类型与网络结构。

Conclusion: SpreadPy为心理学、神经科学和教育研究提供可重复的机制性研究工具。

Abstract: We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation
in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to
perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in
cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in
knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how
activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We
demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading
activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high
versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in
conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that
activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load
modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation
patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs.
phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to
clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model
these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing
mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The
library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology,
neuroscience, and education research.

Motivation: 探索知识编辑在形态丰富的语言（如阿拉伯语）中的行为，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 评估了ROME、MEMIT、ICE和LTE四种方法，并在Llama-2-7B-chat模型上进行了实验。

Result: 参数化方法在跨语言泛化上表现较差，而指令调优方法表现更稳健；多语言联合训练（阿拉伯语-英语）提升了编辑和迁移能力。

Conclusion: 研究为阿拉伯语知识编辑提供了基准数据和方法支持，未来可进一步探索多语言知识编辑。

Abstract: While Knowledge Editing (KE) has been widely explored in English, its
behavior in morphologically rich languages like Arabic remains underexamined.
In this work, we present the first study of Arabic KE. We evaluate four methods
(ROME, MEMIT, ICE, and LTE) on Arabic translations of the ZsRE and Counterfact
benchmarks, analyzing both multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our
experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle
with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more
robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show
that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We
release Arabic KE benchmarks and multilingual training for LTE data to support
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泰国法律问答系统中RAG的性能有限，尤其是在需要复杂法律推理的问题上。

Method: 采用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，利用BGE-M3嵌入作为语义相似性奖励，减少计算成本。

Result: 在NitiBench基准测试中，GRPO实现了90%的引用F1提升和31%的联合质量指标提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂法律推理任务中表现出更强的鲁棒性，为泰国法律LLM提供了一种高效且资源节约的解决方案。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal
question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring
extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce
an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better
response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach
leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward,
significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large
language model judges. Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate
substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the
base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.
Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning
tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and
resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.

TL;DR: MCEval是一个多语言文化评估框架，通过动态文化问题构建和反事实重述等方法，评估大型语言模型的文化偏见和跨文化理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在文化偏见和跨文化理解能力不足的问题，尤其是在服务全球多样化用户时。

Method: 提出MCEval框架，采用动态文化问题构建、反事实重述和混杂重述方法，评估13种文化和13种语言的文化意识和偏见。

Result: 实验显示性能差异与训练数据分布和语言-文化对齐相关，并揭示了公平性问题。

Conclusion: MCEval是首个全面的多语言文化评估框架，为LLMs的文化理解提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural
understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user
populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that
employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis
through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive
evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both
cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The
framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias
instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different
linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not
only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to
language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness
issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create
substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive
multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into
LLMs' cultural understanding.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）的潜在空间中，高层语义信息集中在低维子空间中，且在不同领域中线性可分。这种可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下更明显，支持几何感知工具的开发。

Motivation: 探索LLM内部语义表征的组织方式，以理解其行为并改进对齐。

Method: 对11个基于Transformer的LLM进行大规模实证研究，分析6个科学主题和12层的隐藏状态。

Result: 高层语义信息在低维子空间中线性可分，且可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下增强。几何特性支持简单有效的因果干预。

Conclusion: 研究支持开发几何感知工具，直接操作潜在表征以检测和缓解有害内容，如通过轻量级MLP分类器实现潜在空间防护。

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is
key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However,
it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations
related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs,
analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each.
We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in
low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across
distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers
and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment
behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry
enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example,
reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector
direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware
tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate
harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses
that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this
potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space
guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应的课程学习方法，利用预训练语言模型预测难度分数，优化微调顺序，提升学习效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法依赖人工定义的难度指标（如文本长度），可能无法准确反映模型视角。

Method: 通过预训练语言模型预测难度分数，探索从易到难、从难到易及混合采样的训练策略。

Result: 在四个自然语言理解数据集上验证，相比随机采样，方法收敛更快且性能更优。

Conclusion: 自适应课程学习方法有效，优于传统随机采样策略。

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language
processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing
difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most
existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text
length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To
overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning
paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores
predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these
scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of
examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed
sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU)
datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and
improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

TL;DR: 论文重新定义了点击诱饵（clickbait），提出其核心是制造好奇心缺口，并发布了首个西班牙语点击诱饵检测开源数据集TA1C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对点击诱饵的定义缺乏共识，研究旨在明确其与类似现象（如耸人听闻或标题党）的区别。

Method: 提出新定义，强调信息故意缺失以激发好奇心；创建TA1C数据集，含3,500条西班牙语推文，标注一致性达0.825。

Result: 基线模型F1分数达0.84，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为点击诱饵检测提供了更清晰的定义和高质量数据集，推动了相关领域发展。

Abstract: We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and
argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that
distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and
headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article.
Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating
headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the
goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing
them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets
creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing
the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created
and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the
first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of
3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and
reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong
baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何通过上下文学习完成未见任务，尤其是任务级泛化的内部机制。

Method: 使用路径修补等电路式解释技术，分析模型在错位加法任务中的内部计算。

Result: 发现了一种函数归纳机制，类似先前研究的归纳头机制，但抽象层次更高；+1函数的归纳由多个注意力头并行控制；该机制还可用于其他任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中可复用和组合的结构如何支持任务级泛化，为理解模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen
tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms
inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we
approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,
2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function
as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as
path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their
notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a
function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from
standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the
structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it
to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1
function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which
emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function
induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic
tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8
addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and
composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进检索增强生成（RAG）系统的方法，通过分层文本分割和聚类生成更有语义意义的块，提升了检索的精确性和上下文相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法未能充分捕捉语义信息，因为它们忽略了文本的底层结构。

Method: 提出了一种结合分层文本分割和聚类的框架，利用段级和簇级向量表示进行检索。

Result: 在NarrativeQA、QuALITY和QASPER数据集上的评估显示，该方法优于传统分块技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更语义化的分块策略，显著提升了RAG系统的检索效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies
for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to
access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is
up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to
create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account
for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework
that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering
to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,
the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and
cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of
retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on
the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method
achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

Motivation: 随着奖励模型在测试时策略中的广泛应用，其推理成本成为关注焦点，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合FLAN风格提示、方向性低秩适应（DoRA）和层冻结技术，优化小型模型性能。

Result: TinyRM在RewardBench上表现优异，资源消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: 轻量级双向架构在偏好建模中具有高效、可扩展的潜力，但仍需解决通用模型和对话偏好建模的挑战。

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for
reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,
as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their
inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small,
bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million
parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on
reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style
prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to
achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer
resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from
domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight
finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in
building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our
preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional
architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

Result: ToDi在实验中表现优于现有方法，并在零样本治疗分子生成中展示潜力。

Conclusion: TextOmics和ToDi为靶向药物发现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for
target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and
unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes
one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual
descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates
molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this
foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on
omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically
relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders
(OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic
associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable
generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and
demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also
showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

Result: 模型在三个数据集上显著优于现有方法，并提供可解释的权重。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床干预提供了更精准的工具，有助于理解自杀模式。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention.
Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current
suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing
models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their
ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions.
In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role
in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone.
Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate
suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly
learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on
users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware
Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive
annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also
introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the
varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,
recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established
psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language
models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors
Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better
understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention
strategies.

TL;DR: GeLaCo是一种基于进化的LLM压缩方法，通过层折叠高效探索压缩解空间，支持单目标和多目标优化，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM因计算需求大面临部署和使用障碍，现有压缩方法（如结构化剪枝）成本高且可能忽略更优解。

Method: 采用进化方法（GeLaCo），通过层折叠和基于种群的搜索，结合模块相似性适应度函数（注意力、前馈和隐藏状态表示）。

Result: 在基础和指令调优模型上，GeLaCo通过困惑度和生成评估优于现有方法，并首次建立压缩与质量的Pareto前沿。

Conclusion: GeLaCo为LLM压缩提供高效且性能优越的解决方案，支持多目标优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a
large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to
substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to
reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to
mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as
structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal
variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we
introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer
collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression
solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness
function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations.
GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression
search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality
axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative
evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming
state-of-the-art alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否能真正代表人类价值观，而非简单平均化。

Method: 应用道德基础问卷在19种文化背景下比较LLMs与人类道德直觉的差异。

Result: LLMs系统性地同质化道德多样性，模型规模增加未显著改善文化代表性。

Conclusion: 需改进AI对齐方法和评估指标，以确保AI系统能代表多样人类价值观。

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across
them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs)
fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic
capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral
intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural
contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human
baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.
Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as
synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental
limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment
beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific
moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and
evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather
than flattening the moral landscape.

Conclusion: CRFT为CoT推理提供了轻量高效的表示级优化方法，优于传统PEFT方法。

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly
improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this
work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,
directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at
the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these
fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe
that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical
representations. These representations either integrate significant information
from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through
layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final
output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential
to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we
propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that
identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information
flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,
dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace
while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method
are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,
using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts
effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work

reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT
methods.

*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Qinyu Liu,Jun Zhang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LLM和Transformer的新架构，用于时间序列预测，融合了语义和时间动态信息，提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在时间序列预测中表现不佳，因其擅长处理离散文本而非连续数值数据；而传统Transformer缺乏高级语义学习能力。

Method: 设计了一种新型Transformer架构，融合LLM的语义表征和Transformer的时间动态信息，生成混合表征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在基准数据集上表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 融合LLM和Transformer的架构能有效提升时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies
to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the
given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge
learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning
strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and
semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical
time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to
achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly
trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn
high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel
Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla
Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations
learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series
Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the
representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused
representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic
variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

*Khouloud Saadi,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务的特征蒸馏方法，无需额外参数即可在不同隐藏层尺寸的师生模型间进行知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法要求师生模型隐藏层尺寸相同，限制了学生模型的灵活性，而线性投影方法会引入额外参数并降低性能。

Method: 通过识别教师模型中与任务最相关的隐藏单元，直接将其激活值蒸馏到学生模型，无需新参数。

Result: 在分类、指令跟随和摘要等任务上表现优于基线方法，性能提升达3%。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且高效，适用于多种任务，无需额外参数即可实现知识迁移。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular
are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large
language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically
assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting
the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this
problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but
this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and
often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative
settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based
feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and
student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any
new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components
contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies
the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their
activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with
other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements
over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,
instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance
gain over the linear projection baseline.

*Rohitash Chandra,Jiyong Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在将辱骂性文本转化为非辱骂性文本时的表现，比较了Gemini、GPT-4o、DeepSeek和Groq等模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但其在识别和转化辱骂性文本方面的能力仍需探索。

Method: 使用LLMs识别辱骂性文本并将其转化为非辱骂性版本，同时保留文本的意图。通过情感分析和语义分析评估原始与转化后的数据集。

Result: Groq的表现与其他模型差异显著，而GPT-4o与DeepSeek-V3表现相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在转化辱骂性文本方面具有潜力，但不同模型的表现存在显著差异。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the
classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions
remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform
abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into
non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the
performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and
Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and
obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but
maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text
needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed
datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq
provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have
identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型对阿拉伯语方言和文化细微差别的理解能力，特别是在沙特阿拉伯这种语言多样化的环境中。

Method: 设计了包含18,000多个多选题的Absher基准，涵盖六类任务，并评估了多种先进的大语言模型。

Result: 结果显示模型在需要文化推断或上下文理解的任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 强调需要方言感知训练和文化对齐的评估方法，以提升大语言模型在阿拉伯语应用中的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP
applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural
nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like
Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.
\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six
distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage,
Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived
from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from
various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs,
including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed
insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable
performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or
contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to
improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于进化搜索的自动离散提示优化方法，针对复杂任务和小型语言模型，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示工程方法主要针对简单任务和大型模型，而复杂任务和小型模型对提示设计更敏感，因此需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段进化搜索：第一阶段使用语法引导的遗传编程合成提示创建程序；第二阶段通过局部搜索进一步优化性能。

Result: 在三个小型通用语言模型和四个领域特定任务中，该方法优于PromptWizard、OPRO和RL-Prompt，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂任务和小型模型中表现优异，为自动提示优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained
large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous
solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using
the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art
approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on
very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that
require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount
of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown
to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose
an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic
programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching
the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,
dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,
local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing
programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach
outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,
PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose
LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several
examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance
degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model
combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP模型取得进展，但仍易受对抗攻击（如同义词替换）影响，尤其是循环网络和现代状态空间模型（SSM）的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 引入GBM正则化技术，减少输入扰动对模型输出的影响，并在LSTM、S4和CNN架构上计算GBM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对抗鲁棒性上比现有基线提升8.8%，优于多种先进防御方法。

Conclusion: GBM方法显著提升了NLP模型的对抗鲁棒性，尤其在SSM（S4）架构上首次系统性分析了其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs（如GPT-4）是否能复现人类在语言学任务中的细微判断，以评估其作为研究工具的可靠性。

Method: 进行了四项心理语言学实验（涉及情感意义生成、情感变化、情感语境中的动词选择及句子-表情符号关联），分别由人类和LLM完成，并进行统计分析。

Result: 人类与AI反应高度一致（Spearman's rho = .73-.96），仅在少数情况下存在微小差异，但不影响整体解释。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为语言学研究的有效补充工具，支持大规模研究且不牺牲解释效度，同时为假设生成和数据扩展提供了新可能。

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable
analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective
meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs
like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to
replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four
psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in
emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human
participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across
all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with
statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong
correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor
divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall
interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can
augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies
without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only
strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also
opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.
Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative
collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层隐喻处理模型，将意义视为多层结构，包括内容分析、概念混合和语用意向量，为计算系统提供更丰富的隐喻解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻意义并非简单的概念映射，而是一种复杂的认知现象，需要多层次解释。

Method: 提出三层框架：内容分析、概念混合和语用意向量，逐层处理隐喻。

Result: 模型为计算系统提供了更深入、更上下文敏感的隐喻理解方法。

Conclusion: 该模型为计算隐喻理解提供了新的理论基础，支持更复杂的推理。

Abstract: Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex
cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning
as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2)
conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional
framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to
metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors
are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model
conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at
the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent,
communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding
with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal
framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of
representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper,
more context-sensitive reasoning.

Result: 发现仅解码器Transformer能成功从属性图（如分子图）中提取子结构，展示了其在处理复杂复合模式中的能力。

Conclusion: 研究为序列化Transformer在图数据上执行子结构提取任务提供了新见解。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the
capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures
are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer
related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only
Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address
this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner
mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input
queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,
we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures
the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further
validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across
layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of
Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the
concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite
patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully
extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.
Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers
perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在异步任务导向对话中提出澄清问题的能力，以及模糊性与澄清问题之间的关系。

Method: 结合Minecraft Dialogue Corpus的两种注释，构建新语料库，比较人类和LLMs在模糊性情况下的行为差异，并测试推理能力对LLMs提问的影响。

Result: 人类很少因指代模糊提问，而LLMs更常提问；人类更多因任务不确定性提问，LLMs较少。推理能力可能提升LLMs提问的频率和相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs的澄清问题能力与推理能力相关，但与人类行为差异显著，需进一步研究其机制。

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.

Result: MLAR在2400份简历处理中，平均每份5.4秒，比主流RPA平台快16.9%-17.1%。

Conclusion: MLAR为现代招聘需求提供了高效、准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced
by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to
as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in
resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource
constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job
postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,
experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third
layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to
identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly
into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and
candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR
outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation
Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400
resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,
reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere
and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to
transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展引发了对AI生成文本可靠检测的担忧，尤其是扩散模型的效果未知。

Method: 使用2000个样本，比较LLaDA和LLaMA在困惑度、突发性、词汇多样性、可读性及BLEU/ROUGE分数上的表现。

Result: LLaDA在困惑度和突发性上接近人类文本，而LLaMA困惑度低但词汇保真度差。单一指标无法区分扩散生成文本与人类写作。

Conclusion: 需要开发扩散感知的检测器，如混合模型、扩散特定风格签名和鲁棒水印。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

Motivation: 解决语言模型扩展时计算和内存成本高昂的问题，同时实现参数共享和自适应计算。

Method: MoR框架通过共享层和轻量级路由器动态分配递归深度，选择性缓存键值对，并提出KV共享变体以减少预填充延迟。

Result: 在135M到1.7B参数范围内，MoR显著降低验证困惑度，提高少样本准确率，并提升吞吐量。

Conclusion: MoR是实现高质量大模型而不增加成本的有效路径。

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

Motivation: 填补LLM作为裁判在编码任务中缺乏专用基准测试的空白，评估其有效性和可靠性。

Method: 引入CodeJudgeBench基准测试，对26个LLM裁判模型进行综合评估，研究其在代码生成、修复和单元测试生成任务中的表现。

Result: 思维模型显著优于非思维模型，但所有模型在判断中存在随机性；顺序和内容变化影响准确性；配对比较和保留完整响应可提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM作为裁判在编码任务中表现优异但不可靠，需优化提示策略以提高一致性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art
in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also
serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by
other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking
different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.
However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its
effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of
dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a
benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge
models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and
unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge
models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform
non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even
relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially
trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still
exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise
judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can
substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests
written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in
performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and
consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal
prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise
comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining
comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved

TL;DR: REST是一个新的评估框架，通过同时测试多个问题来评估大型推理模型（LRMs）的性能，揭示现有单问题评估的局限性，并展示更强的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于单问题推理，无法反映真实世界的多上下文压力需求，且容易受到数据污染的影响。

Method: 提出REST框架，同时暴露模型于多个问题，评估其上下文优先级分配、跨问题干扰抵抗和动态认知负载管理等能力。

Result: SOTA模型在REST下表现显著下降，REST比现有基准更具区分力，揭示了单问题评估中未发现的性能差异。

Conclusion: REST是一种高效、面向未来的评估范式，能更好地反映真实需求，减少对人类标注的依赖。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by
isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess
single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical
limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual
creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate
models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world
deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through
Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes
LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST
specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority
allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load
management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance
degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger
discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance
differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under
single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our
analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the
performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique
preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,
outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a
cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects
real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human
annotation.

### [64] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VIL的视角不变学习策略，用于增强视觉语言导航（VLNCE）中导航策略对相机视角变化的鲁棒性，并在V2-VLNCE场景中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航策略对相机视角变化敏感，影响了导航性能。论文旨在通过视角不变学习解决这一问题。

Method: 采用对比学习框架学习稀疏且视角不变的特征，并引入教师-学生框架优化Waypoint Predictor Module，通过端到端训练联合优化。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE场景中，方法在R2R-CE和RxR-CE数据集上的成功率提升了8-15%，且在标准VLNCE设置下也表现优异。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，不仅能提升视角变化下的性能，还能保持标准视角下的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术被广泛用于欺诈、诈骗和政治虚假信息，亟需有效的检测手段。

Method: 利用面部生物特征中的异常模式，开发了一种新的机器学习检测技术。

Result: 在大规模深度伪造数据集上评估了该技术，并测试了其对视频篡改的鲁棒性和对新生成器的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测深度伪造视频，具有较高的可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需数据且任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型（如CLIP）中的隐含偏见。它通过生成场景描述和对比式去偏损失来最小化虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）常继承并放大训练数据中的偏见，导致预测偏差。PRISM旨在无需预定义偏见类别或外部数据的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分为两阶段：1）用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）使用对比式去偏损失学习投影，最小化虚假相关性并保持图像与文本嵌入的对齐。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种高效且无需额外数据的去偏解决方案，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

TL;DR: 提出HMR-ViT方法，结合时空和运动学信息，通过Vision Transformer提升人体网格恢复精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法仅利用时空或运动学信息，未结合两者，限制了性能提升。

Method: 构建时空-运动学特征图像，使用CRM优化特征排列，Vision Transformer编码后回归SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，显著提升了HMR任务的性能。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

Motivation: 在直接测量不可行时，通过视觉观测表征颗粒材料。

Method: 生成合成数据，用NeRF重建3D几何，MPM模拟，贝叶斯优化估计摩擦角。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度内。

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料特性分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注数据量而非质量，缺乏对多模态基础模型生成标签质量的全面研究。

Result: 在开放词汇图像分割领域，VISTA通过定量和定性分析证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: VISTA显著提升了多模态模型生成标签的质量，为数据验证提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种对比损失函数，解决类别不平衡扩散模型中尾部类别图像多样性不足的问题，同时保持头部类别的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡数据导致尾部类别图像合成多样性降低，需在不影响头部类别的情况下提升尾部类别多样性。

Method: 引入无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比学习和条件-无条件对齐增强尾部类别多样性。

Result: 方法在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100-LT等）上优于标准DDPM和其他替代方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，首次将条件-无条件对齐应用于扩散模型，显著提升尾部类别多样性。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和多模态扩展在视频理解方面取得进展，但处理超长视频时仍面临计算、内存和时序一致性等挑战。

Method: 提出将无限视频理解作为研究目标，推动流式架构、持久内存机制、分层表示和事件推理等创新。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是一个雄心勃勃但必要的目标，将为多媒体和AI研究提供方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据的加入显著增加了提示长度和注意力计算的复杂度，导致预填充时间延长，需要优化。

Method: 分析VLM中的注意力模式，发现稀疏性，提出基于输入模板的注意力稀疏掩码（BlindSight），并分类稀疏模式。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上测试，FLOPs平均减少32%-41%，准确率变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight有效优化了VLM推理，减少计算负担，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上分别实现了16.6%和4.7%的相对改进，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过反事实提示可控生成视频模型是高质量光流提取的可扩展且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several

eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

TL;DR: PointSD利用Stable Diffusion模型增强3D点云自监督学习，通过点云引导图像去噪并提取语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D扩散模型受限于小规模数据集，而Stable Diffusion在大规模数据集上表现优异，可用于提升3D表示学习。

Method: 将Stable Diffusion的文本编码器替换为3D编码器，训练点云到图像的扩散模型，并提取SD特征对齐3D特征。

Result: 实验表明，PointSD能有效提升点云自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: Stable Diffusion模型可成功应用于3D点云学习，代码已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

*Maoxiao Ye,Xinfeng Ye,Mano Manoharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成（SLP），解决了传统方法的误差累积和实时性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归方法在推理阶段无法避免误差累积，而扩散模型虽能高质量生成但迭代性质限制了实时应用。

Method: 采用混合自回归和扩散模型的方法，设计了多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上验证了方法在生成质量和实时流效率上的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了两者的优势，显著提升了手语生成的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，SAMPL策略在鲁棒性上优于现有方法，为HOI检测设立了新标准。

Conclusion: RoHOI基准和SAMPL策略有效提升了HOI检测的鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需额外回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙分析为持续学习提供了新视角，MG-CLIP方法简单有效。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++为长期动作生成和细粒度控制提供了新工具，推动了文本到动作生成的研究。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的姿态估计框架，通过非线性MLP视觉语言连接器提升定位精度，优于现有方法LocLLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；语言引导方法（如LocLLM）虽能零样本泛化，但其线性投影器无法捕捉复杂空间-文本交互。

Method: PoseLLM用非线性MLP（两层+GELU激活）替换线性投影器，实现跨模态特征分层融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM（+0.4 AP），并在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器显著提升定位精度且不牺牲泛化能力，推动了语言引导姿态估计的先进水平。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的4D占用预测框架$I^{2}$-World，通过解耦场景标记化实现动态表达和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂3D场景标记化的挑战，提升自动驾驶系统对极端情况的处理能力。

Method: 采用双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合编码器-解码器架构，实现高效4D占用预测。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别超越现有方法25.1%和36.9%，计算效率高（2.9 GB内存，37.0 FPS）。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在4D占用预测中表现优异，兼具高效性和动态表达能力。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Delta Denoising Score在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度上存在不足，主要依赖复杂辅助结构导致优化冲突和局部编辑受限。

Method: SSD利用无分类器引导（CFG）方程实现跨提示对齐，并引入常数项空文本分支稳定优化，同时通过提示增强分支提升编辑强度。

Result: 在2D和3D编辑任务（如NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑）中取得最优结果，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD为文本引导编辑提供了高效、稳定的解决方案，同时保持内容结构一致性和编辑轨迹对齐。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently
carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to
deploy domain randomization over training processes.

Result: 实验表明，LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示有效解决了FSCIL中的性能退化问题，为增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Result: 实验证明MCA-LLaVA在多种幻觉和通用基准测试中有效且通用。

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA通过缓解图像对齐偏差，显著减少了LVLMs中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上，THYME优于现有方法，提升了场景理解的准确性。

Conclusion: THYME方法有效解决了动态场景图的生成问题，为复杂场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Conclusion: Expert-CFG提供了一种高效且低成本的方法，显著提升了MedVLM的准确性和临床对齐性，适用于实际医疗应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for
clinical use.

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线长时点跟踪方法Track-On，基于Transformer模型，无需未来帧信息，在七个公开基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景需要在线预测（仅使用当前和过去帧），而现有方法多为离线设置，依赖未来帧。视觉基础模型虽能提供几何表示，但缺乏时序推理能力。

Method: 评估视觉基础模型的适用性，并提出Track-On模型，将每个跟踪点视为查询，逐帧处理视频，利用记忆传递外观和上下文信息。

Result: Track-On在七个公开基准测试中达到最新技术水平，证明无需未来帧即可实现长时跟踪。

Conclusion: Track-On为在线长时点跟踪提供了有效解决方案，结合视觉基础模型和Transformer架构，实现了高性能的因果推理。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaRFM是一个统一框架，通过Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度对齐惩罚（CMP）解决分布偏移和置信度不对齐问题，提升CLIP和SAM模型在视觉分类和医学分割任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在部署时面临的分布偏移和置信度不对齐问题，这些问题导致预测不准确且过度自信。

Method: 提出StaRFM框架，包含FIP（用于减少嵌入空间的协变量偏移）和CMP（用于校准分割任务的不确定性），并通过理论分析验证其有效性。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集和医学分割任务中，StaRFM显著提升性能（如准确率+3.5%，DSC 84.7%），并降低跨域性能差距40%。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用的框架，能无缝集成到基础模型中，显著提升模型在分布偏移和置信度校准方面的表现。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成先验的方法，从第一人称视角重建可动画化虚拟形象，利用Stable Diffusion减少训练负担并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从第一人称视角重建人体外观时的遮挡和比例失真问题，并探索无需多视图数据集的训练方法。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet，提出一种从遮挡的俯视图像生成真实正面视图的流程，并将其输入到图像到运动模型中。

Result: 实现了从单张俯视图像生成可动画化虚拟形象，减少了训练依赖并提高了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为更易用和泛化的数字远程呈现系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

Conclusion: 因果去偏对复杂场景下的情感识别至关重要。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高阶关联和语义模糊时表现不佳，尤其是软正负样本问题，且未充分利用训练批次中的邻域关系。

Method: AAHR结合动态聚类原型对比学习、全局和局部特征提取、自适应聚合网络、GNN增强语义交互以及动量对比学习扩展负样本集。

Conclusion: AAHR通过综合策略有效解决了图像-文本匹配中的语义模糊和高阶关联问题，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

Motivation: 现有无注释手语翻译方法模型复杂且计算需求高，难以扩展到大尺度数据集。

Method: 采用分段感知视觉标记化框架，将连续视频转换为离散标记，并结合对比对齐目标和双重监督。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准测试中性能超越现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效标记化和跨模态对齐策略，显著提升了无注释手语翻译的扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Result: 在N-Caltech101和CEP-DVS数据集上，CKD方法优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: CKD方法有效提升了SNN在事件数据上的性能，为跨模态和跨架构知识蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Result: 在PMC-VQA基准测试中达到最先进的医疗视觉问答性能，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust展示了自动化提示工程在提升MLLMs可信度方面的潜力，尤其适用于安全关键场景。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our
codebase can be found at https://github.com/xingbpshen/vccrl-llm.

Result: 在挑战性基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并扩展到盲非均匀运动去模糊。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效降低了BMD对初始核的敏感性，提升了性能，且易于与现有方法集成。

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 框架能轻松整合额外元数据（如房间标签），进一步提升准确性和效率。

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

*Zhiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAA*的新方法，通过引入路径角度自由度（PAF）改进A*算法，提升路径平滑性和相似性。实验表明DAA*在路径相似性和长度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路径平滑性在模仿学习中被忽视，作者希望通过改进A*算法提升路径相似性和平滑性。

Method: 提出DAA*方法，结合PAF优化路径平滑性和缩短路径长度，通过联合优化路径缩短和平滑性。

Result: 在7个数据集上验证，DAA*在路径相似性上显著优于神经A*和TransPath，提升9.0% SPR、6.9% ASIM和3.9% PSIM。

Conclusion: DAA*在路径模仿学习中表现出色，平衡了路径最优性和搜索效率。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

*Zile Wang,Hao Yu,Jiabo Zhan,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ALPHA基准和ALPHAVAE模型，用于RGBA图像生成，显著提升了透明图像的重建和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前潜在扩散模型在RGB图像合成上表现优异，但透明或分层内容（RGBA）生成缺乏大规模基准和有效方法。

Method: 提出了ALPHA基准，将RGB指标扩展到四通道图像；设计了ALPHAVAE模型，通过复合目标训练，结合RGB和alpha通道的潜在表示。

Result: ALPHAVAE在仅8K图像训练下，PSNR提升4.9 dB，SSIM提升3.2%，并在潜在扩散框架中实现更优的透明图像生成。

Conclusion: ALPHA和ALPHAVAE为RGBA图像生成提供了有效基准和模型，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on
https://github.com/o0o0o00o0/AlphaVAE for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，用于评估多模态对话系统的主动交互能力，PAUC比传统指标更符合人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态对话系统的研究发展，用户期望系统能更主动地交互，例如在视频播放时实时决定多轮响应时机。

Method: 引入ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，考虑模型响应的时间动态性，并通过用户研究验证其有效性。

Result: PAUC比传统指标更符合人类偏好，能更准确地评估主动交互场景中的用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互场景提供了更可靠的评估方法，推动了多模态对话系统的研究进展。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

*Kaixuan Cong,Yifan Wang,Rongkun Xue,Yuyang Jiang,Yiming Feng,Jing Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态类间混淆感知编码器（DICCAE），通过细粒度类别级对齐音频-视频表示，增强模型对相似活动的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练范式仅关注整体模态对齐，未考虑通过认知归纳和对比强化易混淆类别的区分。

Method: DICCAE动态调整混淆损失以应对类间混淆，并结合音频、视频及其融合的新训练框架。为解决数据稀缺问题，提出聚类引导的自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的top-1准确率，接近SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过模块化设计和动态混淆损失，显著提升了音频-视频任务的性能。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast3D提出了一种针对3D多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉令牌剪枝框架，通过全局注意力预测和样本自适应剪枝技术，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D MLLMs在场景理解方面表现出色，但计算效率低下限制了其实际部署。现有2D视觉令牌剪枝方法不适用于3D领域，因此需要探索新的解决方案。

Method: Fast3D包含两项技术创新：1) 全局注意力预测（GAP），通过轻量级神经网络预测注意力分布以指导剪枝；2) 样本自适应剪枝（SAP），根据输入动态调整剪枝比例。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，Fast3D在高剪枝比例下仍保持有效性，验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: Fast3D为3D MLLMs提供了一种高效且无需修改模型参数的剪枝方法，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于预训练的简单编码器架构在交通异常检测（TAD）中的表现，发现其性能优于复杂方法，且自监督预训练效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究复杂多阶段或多表示融合架构是否必要，探索预训练如何使简单架构超越专业设计。

Method: 使用纯视频视觉变换器（Video ViTs）作为编码器，研究不同预训练方法（弱监督、全监督、自监督）对TAD的影响。

Result: 强预训练使简单编码器性能匹配或超越现有方法；自监督掩码视频建模（MVM）效果最佳；领域自适应预训练（DAPT）进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单架构结合有效预训练可实现高效、可扩展的TAD模型。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has
increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and
manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging.
These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for
accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions
affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing
workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational
resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process
camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for
small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By
focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for
data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover
meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 提出的高效时空设计在多人物运动预测中表现出色，兼具性能与效率。

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决PEFT-CL方法中因独立训练子模块导致特征空间不对齐，从而在误导性任务ID下产生模糊决策的问题。

Method: 提出双级知识对齐（DKA）和任务置信度引导的适配器混合（TC-MoA），分别用于训练和推理阶段的鲁棒性增强。

Result: 实验表明CKAA优于现有PEFT-CL方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过特征对齐和自适应知识聚合，显著提升了模型在误导性任务ID下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Motivation: 现有方法MERU虽成功将多模态学习技术从欧几里得空间扩展到双曲空间，但如何更高效地训练模型以利用层次结构仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出HMID-Net，首次在双曲空间中结合MIM和知识蒸馏技术，并设计了专门的双曲空间知识蒸馏损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在双曲空间中的表现与欧几里得空间相当，并在图像分类和检索任务中显著优于MERU和CLIP等现有模型。

Conclusion: HMID-Net为双曲空间中的高效模型训练提供了新思路，验证了MIM和知识蒸馏技术在双曲空间中的有效性。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个新的视频理解基准，旨在评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能真正进行视频级推理，而非仅依赖关键帧或文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试多基于图像级问题，无法评估模型是否具备深层次的时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个视觉中心问题，覆盖11个类别，要求模型观看完整视频并推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，但最佳LVLM（GPT-o3）仅达66.43%，显示模型仍难以超越表面推理。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在视频级推理上的不足，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于张量分解和正则化的自适应网络（SDTN）及轻量级网络（TRN），用于高光谱图像分类，解决了高维数据和标注样本不足的问题，显著提升了精度并降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理高维高光谱数据时性能不佳，且标注样本稀缺，需要一种更高效、自适应的分类方法。

Method: 结合张量分解与正则化机制（SDTN）动态调整张量秩，提取最优特征；进一步通过轻量级网络（TRN）捕获多尺度光谱-空间特征。

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上实验显示，相比现有方法，精度显著提升且模型参数减少。

Conclusion: SDTN和TRN框架在高光谱分类中表现优异，适合资源受限的实时部署。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可靠的测试时适应方法（ReTA），通过一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC）解决现有缓存方法在分布偏移下的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在无标注数据时面临分布偏移问题，现有缓存方法因熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活导致性能下降。

Method: ReTA结合CER（利用一致性约束加权熵）和DDC（将文本嵌入建模为高斯分布以调整决策边界），提升缓存质量和预测准确性。

Result: 实验表明ReTA在真实分布偏移下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过双重策略显著提升了测试时适应的可靠性，适用于复杂分布偏移场景。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Motivation: 微手势在线识别任务具有挑战性，需精确定位和分类视频中的微手势实例，且微手势与其他人类动作差异较大。

Method: 采用手工数据增强和时空注意力机制，提升模型的分类和定位能力。

Result: F1分数达到38.03，比之前的最佳方法提升了37.9%，排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法在微手势在线识别任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过去除冗余空间激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VMamba等基于SSM的视觉骨干模型中空间冗余问题，提升效率而不需重新训练。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，通过剪枝冗余空间激活并在扫描前通过最近邻上采样恢复维度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现11%的速度提升，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和MedMamba上也有类似效果。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的部署效率工具，适用于SSM模型，且不影响迁移性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MENTOR是一个新的自回归框架，用于高效的多模态条件调整，解决了现有文本到图像模型在精确视觉控制、多模态输入平衡和复杂多模态图像生成训练需求方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在精确视觉控制和多模态输入平衡方面表现不足，且需要大量训练资源。

Method: MENTOR采用两阶段训练范式：多模态对齐阶段和多模态指令调整阶段，结合自回归图像生成器，实现细粒度的多模态输入与图像输出的对齐。

Result: 在DreamBench++基准测试中表现优异，优于竞争基线，同时提供更高的图像重建保真度、广泛的任务适应性和更高的训练效率。

Conclusion: MENTOR通过创新的两阶段训练框架，显著提升了多模态图像生成的性能和控制能力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to
diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at:

TL;DR: DehazeSB是一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，利用最优传输理论直接连接雾图和清晰图的分布，实现高质量去雾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限，效果受限。

Method: 采用Schrödinger Bridge和最优传输理论，引入细节保留正则化和基于CLIP的提示学习。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视频推理范式ViTCoT，结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升了视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理方法主要依赖文本信息，忽略了视觉模态，而人类推理时会自然结合视觉内容。

Method: 构建了Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB)，并探索ViTCoT范式在视频理解中的应用。

Result: ViTCoT显著优于传统文本CoT范式，并激活了更多MLLM神经元。

Conclusion: ViTCoT为视频推理提供了更直观且认知对齐的方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

TL;DR: VDInstruct是一种多模态大语言模型，通过内容感知的分词策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的理解能力，同时减少了计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在密集文档上表现不佳，且分词方法效率低下，导致计算和内存浪费。

Method: VDInstruct采用内容感知分词策略，根据文档复杂度生成分词，并结合三阶段训练范式。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，零样本评估中F1分数超过基线5.5分，图像分词减少3.6倍。

Conclusion: 内容感知分词与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究重新评估了两种CLIP变体（ResNet和ViT）在bouba-kiki效应中的表现，发现模型未能像人类一样一致地关联形状与伪词，揭示了多模态模型在跨模态理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言模型（VLMs）是否像人类一样整合跨模态信息，尤其是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用基于提示的概率评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析，对比ResNet和ViT的表现。

Result: 模型未表现出一致的bouba-kiki效应，且与人类数据相比表现显著不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解上存在局限，与人类认知的整合程度仍有差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在红外小目标检测中过于依赖复杂架构，忽视了目标稀疏性的先验知识，导致模型效率低且泛化能力差。

Method: 基于RPCA模型，设计了动态RPCA网络（DRPCA-Net），通过轻量级超网络动态生成迭代参数，并结合动态残差组（DRG）模块优化背景建模。

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有方法，检测精度更高。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态机制和稀疏先验的结合，实现了高效且鲁棒的红外小目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Conclusion: FaceLLM展示了语言模型合成监督的潜力，为可信赖的多模态AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search
engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one
of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization
tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this

script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this
paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters
using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a
methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a
convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text
recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character
dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each
of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This
approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36%

Conclusion: EHPE有效解决了误差累积问题，显著提升了手部姿态估计的精度。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1

annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EmRACE-3K数据集，用于评估和改进视觉语言模型在具身环境中的推理能力，展示了当前模型的局限性及其改进潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在被动任务中表现优异，但在需要在线交互和主动场景理解的具身环境中表现有限。

Method: 构建EmRACE-3K数据集，包含3,000多个语言引导任务，并通过监督学习和强化学习微调模型。

Result: 零样本测试中模型成功率低于20%，但微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K为提升具身推理能力提供了有效工具，展示了模型改进的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: WordCraft是一个交互式艺术字体系统，结合扩散模型解决现有方法的局限性，支持局部编辑、迭代优化和多语言输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统艺术字体设计依赖手工，现有生成模型缺乏交互性和灵活性。

Method: 采用无训练的区域注意力机制和噪声混合技术，结合大语言模型解析用户提示。

Result: 系统能生成高质量、多样化的艺术字体，支持多语言和多字符输入。

Conclusion: WordCraft显著提升了艺术字体合成的交互性，为设计师提供了更多创意可能。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

Conclusion: Inter2Former通过动态计算分配策略，成功平衡了交互式分割的速度与精度，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

Motivation: 现有方法在无监督适应中无法捕捉细粒度类别差异或计算成本高，FAIR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FAIR通过类描述锚点（CDA）和学习对齐分数（LAS）动态对齐图像和语言特征，并引入自训练加权机制优化伪标签。

Result: FAIR在13个细粒度数据集上平均性能提升2.78%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态对齐和交互优化，显著提升了细粒度无监督适应的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

TL;DR: GAA是一个基于区域引导的少样本异常图像-掩码对生成框架，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型生成真实、多样且语义对齐的异常，解决了现有方法在异常合成中的低真实性和对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中异常样本稀缺，现有异常合成方法存在低真实性、掩码对齐不准确和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: GAA采用局部概念分解建模异常语义和空间信息，自适应多轮异常聚类增强表示一致性，区域引导掩码生成确保对齐，并通过低质量样本过滤提升生成质量。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA通过区域引导和少样本学习，显著提升了异常合成的真实性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性学习显著提升了眼部分割和视线估计的鲁棒性，适用于AR/VR交互。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately
capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints.
To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with

### [150] [Token Compression Meets Compact Vision Transformers: A Survey and Comparative Evaluation for Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09702)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了对视觉Transformer（ViT）中令牌压缩技术的系统分类和比较研究，填补了现有研究的空白，并揭示了其在紧凑型ViT中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补令牌压缩技术缺乏统一分类和比较的空白，并探索其在紧凑型ViT上的有效性。

Method: 提出系统分类法，并在标准和紧凑型ViT架构上评估代表性令牌压缩技术。

Result: 令牌压缩在通用ViT中有效，但在紧凑型设计中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在边缘AI中适配令牌优化技术提供了实践指导和研究方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的变分分数蒸馏方法（$L^2$-VSD），通过调整优化顺序和线性化模型，解决了传统VSD方法的收敛问题和训练不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VSD方法在实践中存在收敛慢和训练不稳定的问题，作者发现这是由于LoRA与3D分布不匹配导致的。

Method: 提出线性化前瞻变分分数蒸馏（$L^2$-VSD），通过调整优化顺序和线性化模型改进梯度修正。

Result: 实验证明$L^2$-VSD优于现有方法，并能无缝集成到其他VSD框架中。

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD有效解决了VSD的实践问题，提升了文本到3D生成的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效混合（几何和图像）方法，用于计算碎片对的最优对齐，无需假设其形状、尺寸或图像内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理真实拼图中碎片的几何特性，或依赖碎片形状限制。

Method: 结合几何和图像信息计算碎片对齐，引入新的碎片数据集和侵蚀模型。

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了兼容性性能，适用于考古拼图等实际应用。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

TL;DR: NegRefine提出了一种改进的负标签细化框架，用于零样本OOD检测，通过过滤子类别标签和专有名词，并引入多匹配感知评分函数，提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于负标签的方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时存在误判问题，尤其是子类别标签和专有名词导致的问题，以及多标签匹配的局限性。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤机制排除负标签集中的子类别标签和专有名词，并采用动态调整多标签匹配贡献的评分函数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中，NegRefine表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NegRefine显著提升了零样本OOD检测的鲁棒性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

TL;DR: 提出了VRU-Accident基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在涉及弱势道路使用者（VRUs）的高风险交通场景中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏标准化基准来定量评估MLLMs在涉及VRUs的复杂安全关键场景中的推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含1K真实事故视频、6K多选题对和1K密集场景描述的VRU-Accident基准，并对17种先进MLLMs进行评估。

Result: MLLMs在视觉基础属性上表现良好，但在推理事故原因、类型和可预防性方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了评估MLLMs在VRU安全场景中的空白，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

Motivation: 研究深度学习模型是否形成与人类相似的3D形状表征。

Method: 通过实验操纵点密度、物体方向和局部几何结构，比较人类与两种深度学习模型（DGCNN和点变换器）的表现。

Result: 点变换器模型在全局3D形状表征上更接近人类表现，优于卷积神经网络模型。

Conclusion: 点变换器模型的层次抽象机制使其更接近人类的3D形状识别方式。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，实现有效性、稀疏性、接近性和真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: CECAS通过因果引导显著提升了反事实解释的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

Motivation: 现有方法直接学习RGB到HSI的映射，忽视了从低维到高维转换的固有挑战。

Method: MCGA采用两阶段方法：1）多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式并提取混合码本（MoC）；2）通过查询MoC特征优化RGB到HSI映射，引入灰度感知注意力和量化自注意力。

Result: 实验表明MCGA在HSI重建中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MCGA通过引入先验知识和高效注意力机制，实现了轻量且高质量的HSI重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变对航空图像检测器性能有显著提升，多分支头设计有效平衡了参数量和精度。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

Conclusion: IGD为图形设计提供了一种高效、可扩展且可编辑的新方法。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff能高效生成多样且高质量的样本，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多图像超分辨率（MISR）和卷积神经网络（CNN）的方法，用于在超低电子剂量条件下实现原子级分辨率的电子显微镜成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜在原子分辨率下对光束敏感材料（如蛋白质和2D材料）的成像受到辐射损伤的限制。

Method: 通过融合多个低分辨率、亚像素位移的图像，并利用CNN增强重建，开发了一种双路径注意力引导网络，用于4D-STEM。

Result: 在超低剂量条件下，该方法实现了与传统ptychography相当的空间分辨率，适用于非晶、半晶和晶态光束敏感样品。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用且高效的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖KL散度估计不确定性，忽略了模态间的领域差距，KPHD-Net旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用变分Dirichlet分布表示类别概率分布，结合Hölder散度和Dempster-Shafer证据理论进行多视图融合。

Result: 实验表明KPHD-Net在分类和聚类任务中优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性、鲁棒性和可靠性。

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进的不确定性估计和多视图融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and
rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments
can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking
technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques,
particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced
detection and tracking algorithms. This paper first reviews the characteristics
and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in
recent years. Finally, based on the above research, this paper outlines future
research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种图像序列二项式自补偿（I-BSC）方法，用于动态测量中减少运动误差，相比相位序列二项式自补偿（P-BSC）降低了计算复杂度并提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相位移相轮廓术（PSP）在动态测量中因物体运动导致的误差问题。

Method: 通过加权求和同质条纹图像（I-BSC）而非相位帧（P-BSC），减少计算复杂度并提高误差收敛速度。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现了准单帧速率，计算复杂度降低了一个多项式阶，计算帧速率提升数倍至数十倍。

Conclusion: I-BSC方法在动态3D扫描中显著提升了性能，适用于高像素-深度-时间分辨率的3D重建。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练连接器模块时计算成本高，且单模态模型选择复杂，亟需一种高效解决方案。

Method: 利用超网络的参数预测能力，为多种单模态模型组合联合训练连接器模块。

Result: Hyma将最优单模态模型对的搜索成本降低10倍，同时在多模态基准测试中表现与网格搜索相当。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，适用于多模态模型构建中的单模态模型选择和连接器训练。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架为内存高效的模型个性化提供了有效解决方案，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

Conclusion: LifelongPR有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，提升了模型的适应性和实用性。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D

By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is

*Haonan Chen,Xin Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SegFormer的两阶段迁移学习策略，用于解决遥感图像水体分割中的领域偏移和小样本问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像水体分割中因领域差异和小样本导致的模型性能下降问题。

Method: 采用两阶段迁移学习策略：先在多样源域上训练基础分割模型，再在目标域数据上微调。

Result: 目标域的水体分割IoU从25.50%提升至64.84%。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了领域差异问题，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供了高精度信息提取的技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在短文本任务中表现良好，但在长文本输入（>77 token）时受限。

Method: 提出FIX-CLIP，包括双分支训练、区域提示和分层特征对齐模块，并利用合成数据训练。

Result: FIX-CLIP在长文本和短文本检索任务中达到SOTA，且适用于扩散模型的长文本输入。

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP有效解决了长文本输入问题，同时保持了短文本能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

Motivation: 解决多摄像头场景下目标身份一致性分配的挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架在多摄像头多目标跟踪中表现高效且一致。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级标注成本高且耗时，半监督分割方法通过利用少量标注图像和大量未标注图像训练模型，但基础模型的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出DEARLi方法，结合CLIP的零样本分类和SAM的伪标签，通过无监督掩码-变换器一致性和类无关解码器预热，分别增强识别和定位能力。

Result: 在ADE20K数据集上仅用158张标注图像，取得了29.9 PQ和38.9 mIoU的优异性能，同时GPU内存需求降低8倍。

Conclusion: DEARLi在半监督语义分割中表现卓越，尤其在标注数据稀缺和大分类场景下，为半监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Conclusion: 改进的点跟踪方法在临床评估中表现更优，与专家验证工具更接近，具有更好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Motivation: 生物视觉系统依赖反馈连接迭代优化感知，而人工神经网络多为前馈结构，缺乏动态优化能力。

Result: 反馈模型在噪声条件下表现更优，仅需两个训练样本即可超越随机性能，而前馈模型需至少四个。

Conclusion: 反馈机制增强了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更自适应、生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题和手动标注的高成本，合成数据被广泛用于预训练，但合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距（如光照、颜色和视角差异）限制了模型效果。

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 双级域适应方法有效提升了文本人物检索的性能，解决了合成与真实数据间的域差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在高分辨率图像中表现不佳，因训练与测试分辨率不一致导致泛化能力差。

Method: ECP框架：先提取候选区域，再基于候选区域预测，无需训练且任务无关。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务中分别提升21.3%、5.8%、5.2%。

Conclusion: ECP有效保留细粒度细节，提升MLLMs在高分辨率图像中的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习常因不平衡学习导致性能不如单模态学习，现有方法通过梯度平衡解决，但作者认为平衡学习并非最优。

Method: 提出ARL策略，通过辅助正则器计算模态预测方差，利用方差比重新加权优化，并引入预测偏差联合优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: ARL无需额外参数，独立于多模态模型结构，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Result: 实验揭示了种族偏见的影响，并提出了一种整合种族背景的情绪特征学习框架。

Conclusion: 种族背景对情绪表达有显著影响，未来研究需更细致地考虑文化差异。

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 多模态学习性能常低于单模态学习，现有方法仅关注模态间不平衡，未解释主导模态性能下降的原因。

Method: 提出DGL框架，通过截断多模态损失梯度并替换为单模态损失梯度，消除梯度干扰。

Result: 实验证明DGL在多模态任务中有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL解决了多模态模型中的优化冲突，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化人类图像生成需要精确保留属性（如身份、服装细节），现有方法计算成本高且不适用于实时应用。

Method: 训练仅LoRA层，利用空间参考减少信息丢失，并引入选择性主题区域损失以优化生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，且无需推理时额外参数。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA实现了高效、高保真的个性化人类图像生成，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

Result: 在合成和真实数据上，VRFNO显著优于Reflow，达到单步和少步生成任务的最优性能。

Conclusion: VRFNO有效解决了Reflow的局限性，为高质量快速图像生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集预测方法通常计算成本高且参数多，SL旨在通过维度提升实现高效、准确的预测。

Method: SL将2D输入（如图像）提升到高维空间（如3D），并使用高维网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集上验证，SL减少98%参数并降低推理成本，性能与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种高效、准确且可靠的新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练视觉语言模型在检测OOD样本时，对接近InD数据的挑战性OOD样本仍存在误分类问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型和MLLMs生成合成OOD数据，通过迭代修复和基于能量分数的噪声调整优化样本，并微调CLIP模型。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界对齐的OOD数据，有效提升了模型的OOD检测能力，且计算开销小。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了AID模型在现实世界中的局限性，并提出了改进方向，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Result: 风格迁移显著减少纹理偏差，提升对图像损坏和对抗攻击的鲁棒性，适用于多种网络架构和数据集。

Conclusion: 风格迁移在语义分割中有效减少纹理偏差并增强鲁棒性，具有普适性。

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 在稀疏输入的物体中心场景中，背景纹理可能显著影响相机位姿估计的准确性，因此需要一种有效的攻击方法。

Method: 引入KBA，利用多对称性圆盘生成高相似性背景纹理，并提出投影方向一致性损失优化攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，优化的对抗性背景能有效攻击多种相机位姿估计模型。

Conclusion: KBA方法在攻击相机位姿估计模型方面表现出高效性。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Motivation: 传统Transformer架构将图像嵌入为均匀的网格标记，忽略了语义区域，导致特征表示不理想。

Method: 引入模糊标记聚类Transformer（FTCFormer），结合DPC-FKNN聚类中心确定、SCS标记分配和Cmerge标记合并策略。

Result: 在32个数据集上验证，FTCFormer在细粒度、自然图像、医学和遥感数据集上分别提升1.43%、1.09%、0.97%和0.55%。

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的标记生成和优化策略，显著提升了图像分类性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

Motivation: 传统方法在严重退化情况下难以保留细粒度的身份特征，导致结果缺乏个体特性。

Method: IP-FVR引入参考图像作为视觉提示，采用解耦交叉注意力机制、反馈学习和指数混合策略，结合多流负提示优化修复过程。

Result: 实验表明IP-FVR在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，质量和身份一致性表现突出。

Conclusion: IP-FVR在面部视频修复中具有显著潜力，尤其在身份保留和细节恢复方面表现优异。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Motivation: 线性投影器在视频MLLM中导致语义模糊和时间不连贯，而现有方法未能有效解决这些问题。

Method: DisCo包含视觉概念鉴别器（VCD）模块和时间焦点校准器（TFC）模块，分别确保语义清晰和时间连贯。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，DisCo显著优于现有方法，并提高了token效率。

Conclusion: DisCo为视频MLLM提供了一种高效且语义清晰的视觉封装解决方案。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Result: 在Phoenix-2014T基准测试中，性能优于单流变体，达到无注释方法的最高BLEU-4分数。

Conclusion: 双编码器框架在无注释手语翻译中表现优越。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

Conclusion: IMD通过扩散模型和交互提示模块，显著提升了多实例特征匹配的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Conclusion: FGSSNet通过特征引导显著提升了墙分割性能，证明了其设计合理性。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了VRGAdapter的有效性。

Conclusion: VRGAdapter提供了一种更通用的适配器解决方案，显著提升了VLM在下游任务中的性能。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: FG-ZSD问题具有实际意义，MSHC方法在细粒度检测中表现优异，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

### [209] [Improving Remote Sensing Classification using Topological Data Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10381)
*Aaryam Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将拓扑数据分析（TDA）特征与深度学习模型结合的方法，显著提升了遥感图像分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络（CNN）偏向于纹理特征，而TDA能有效描述复杂数据的几何信息，结合两者可提升分类效果。

Method: 设计了一个TDA特征工程流程，并将其与ResNet18模型结合，用于遥感图像分类。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上达到99.33%准确率，超过所有单模型结果；在RESISC45数据集上比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征能与深度学习结合，即使数据无显式拓扑结构，扩展了TDA的适用性。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

TL;DR: SC-AGIQA是一种新框架，通过文本-视觉语义约束提升AI生成图像的质量评估，解决了语义对齐和细节感知问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估AI生成图像时存在语义不对齐和细节缺失的问题，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出TSAM模块和FFDPM模块，分别利用多模态大语言模型和频域分析改进语义对齐和视觉质量评估。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，SC-AGIQA优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过统一框架显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏语义关键点，获取困难且不可靠，因此提出无需关键点标注的解决方案。

Method: 引入密集特征网络将2D表示映射到SMAL参数，并结合分层对齐策略整合多级视觉线索。

Result: 实验表明4D-Animal优于基于模型和无模型的基线方法，生成的高质量3D资产可用于其他任务。

Conclusion: 4D-Animal具有大规模应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

Result: 评估多个LVLM模型，揭示其在珊瑚图像分析中的局限与机遇。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为珊瑚保护提供新基准，推动LVLM在生态领域的应用。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种基于内容自适应卷积的新架构，通过RAPConv和PAN-DFF模块提升遥感图像融合的精度和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因卷积核的均匀应用而忽略局部内容变化，限制了性能。

Method: RAPNet采用RAPConv生成空间自适应卷积核，并结合PAN-DFF模块通过注意力机制平衡空间细节和光谱保真度。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，消融实验验证了其自适应组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应卷积和动态特征融合，显著提升了遥感图像融合的性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Result: 在多种骨干模型上表现优异，身份保留和参考特征转移质量显著提升。

Conclusion: RefSTAR方法有效解决了盲人脸图像恢复中的身份保留问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

Motivation: 解决时间戳预测与地理定位的相互依赖问题，提升图像时间预测的准确性。

Result: GT-Loc在时间预测和地理定位任务中表现优异，甚至优于依赖真实地理位置的方法。

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间和位置预测，显著提升了性能，并支持组合和基于文本的图像检索。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Method: 采用SF2D（半监督联邦学习）、室内定位导航系统和视觉识别系统，结合可穿戴设备和边缘设备。

Result: SF2D准确率99.19%，视觉识别96.3%，导航系统95%，综合准确率达99.99%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效可靠，隐私友好，适用于老年人跌倒检测。

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且性能优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 新基准和方法为视网膜异常检测提供了更全面的评估框架，NFM-DRA成为新的SOTA。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at

Motivation: 多视角计算机视觉任务中，相机几何关系对3D感知至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用这些关系。

Result: 实验表明，PRoPE在多种任务（如新视角合成、立体深度估计）中显著提升性能，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: PRoPE能有效捕捉相机几何关系，适用于多种任务和模型规模。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

Motivation: 科学政策设计需要更深入理解小农户农业系统的基本属性，如农田空间分布和地块大小，但现有数据不足。

Method: 结合超高分辨率（1.5米）地球观测数据和深度迁移学习，最小化参考数据需求并提高可迁移性。

Result: 绘制了莫桑比克全国农田分布图，准确区分农田与非农用地，地块空间一致性中位数IoU为0.81。地块大小平均0.32公顷，但差异显著。

Conclusion: 地块大小是农业社会经济与环境结果（如粮食生产、生计、森林砍伐）的关键指标，研究为政策制定提供了重要数据支持。

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高压缩率VQ-VAE训练计算成本高，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 利用预训练VAE，结合通道多组量化和后矫正器，减少量化误差。

Result: ReVQ在ImageNet上仅用512个token实现高质量重建（rFID=1.06），训练成本降低两个数量级。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量间取得优越平衡，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification
performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.
