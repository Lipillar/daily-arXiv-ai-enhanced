### [1] [IndoPref: A Multi-Domain Pairwise Preference Dataset for Indonesian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22159)
*Vanessa Rebecca Wiyono,David Anugraha,Ayu Purwarianti,Genta Indra Winata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个完全由人类撰写、多领域的印尼语偏好数据集IndoPref，用于评估LLM生成文本的自然性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决印尼语在LLM偏好研究中代表性不足的问题，避免依赖英语翻译导致的文化和语言真实性缺失。

Method: 创建IndoPref数据集，所有标注均为印尼语原生撰写，并使用Krippendorff's alpha评估标注者一致性。

Result: 数据集展示了强标注者一致性，并用于多LLM模型的输出质量评估。

Conclusion: IndoPref填补了印尼语偏好数据集的空白，为LLM研究提供了更真实的评估工具。

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains
significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language
models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English
translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic
authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully
human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically
designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All
annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using
Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement.
Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the
output quality of each model.

### [2] [Persona-Augmented Benchmarking: Evaluating LLMs Across Diverse Writing Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22168)
*Kimberly Le Truong,Riccardo Fogliato,Hoda Heidari,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM评估基准缺乏写作风格多样性，提出通过基于角色的提示方法测试LLM性能，发现写作风格显著影响评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准未能充分体现人类沟通的多样性，可能导致LLM在非标准输入下表现脆弱。

Method: 使用基于角色的LLM提示方法重写评估提示，模拟多样写作风格。

Result: 写作风格和提示格式的变化显著影响LLM性能评估，某些风格在不同模型和任务中表现一致。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展的方法增强现有基准，提高评估的外部有效性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

### [3] [A Scalable Pipeline for Estimating Verb Frame Frequencies Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22187)
*Adam M. Morgan,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化流程，利用大语言模型（LLM）估计动词框架频率（VFF），优于现有工具，并生成新数据库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在规模、准确性或可访问性上有限，无法满足需求。

Method: 使用LLM生成句子语料库，并指导其像语言学家一样分析句法结构。

Result: 该流程在多个评估数据集上优于常用句法分析器，且资源消耗低。

Conclusion: 展示了自动化框架频率估计的可行性，并开源代码和数据支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

### [4] [The role of media memorability in facilitating startups' access to venture capital funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22201)
*L. Toschi,S. Torrisi,A. Fronzetti Colladon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出媒体记忆性概念，揭示其对风投决策的影响，强调初创企业需通过独特性和语义网络连接提升品牌记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨媒体内容如何通过更细致的线索（如记忆性）影响风投决策，弥补以往研究仅关注媒体曝光的不足。

Method: 基于197家英国微纳米技术初创企业（1995-2004年）的数据，分析媒体记忆性对投资结果的影响。

Result: 媒体记忆性显著影响投资结果，风投更关注初创企业的独特性和新闻语义网络中的连接性。

Conclusion: 初创企业应通过突出独特性和行业相关性来增强品牌记忆性，而非仅追求媒体曝光频率。

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In
practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand
memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their
uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

### [5] [How Well Does First-Token Entropy Approximate Word Entropy as a Psycholinguistic Predictor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22209)
*Christian Clark,Byung-Doh Oh,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了上下文熵作为心理语言学指标的局限性，提出蒙特卡洛方法改进熵估计，并发现其与首词标记熵的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决传统基于首词标记的熵估计方法导致的低估和失真问题。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛方法生成更准确的词熵估计，允许词跨多个标记。

Result: 实验显示蒙特卡洛熵与首词标记熵在阅读时间回归分析中结果不同。

Conclusion: 结论指出需谨慎使用首词标记近似熵，蒙特卡洛方法更可靠。

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

### [6] [RL from Teacher-Model Refinement: Gradual Imitation Learning for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22219)
*Dongyub Jude Lee,Zhenyi Ye,Pengcheng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLfR是一种新的机器翻译偏好学习方法，通过外部教师模型（GPT-4o）提供连续反馈，替代静态三元组数据，显著提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖静态三元组数据且泛化能力有限，RLfR旨在通过动态反馈解决这一问题。

Method: RLfR将翻译步骤视为微教程，演员生成假设，教师模型优化，演员根据与优化结果的匹配度获得奖励，结合负编辑距离和COMET分数作为信号。

Result: 在FLORES-200基准测试中，RLfR在语义充分性和实体保留方面显著优于MT-SFT和基于偏好的基线方法。

Conclusion: RLfR通过动态反馈和渐进学习，显著提升了机器翻译的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

### [7] [Meaning-infused grammar: Gradient Acceptability Shapes the Geometric Representations of Constructions in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22286)
*Supantho Rakshit,Adele Goldberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否学习到基于功能的梯度表征，通过分析英语双宾语和介词宾语结构的神经表征，发现模型内部表征确实反映了梯度偏好强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证基于使用的构式理论（UCx）是否适用于LLMs，即模型是否学习到功能驱动的梯度表征。

Method: 使用Pythia-1.4B模型分析5000对句子的神经表征，通过能量距离和Jensen-Shannon散度测量表征分离性。

Result: 模型表征的分离性受梯度偏好强度调节，更典型的构式样本在激活空间中占据更独特区域。

Conclusion: LLMs学习了丰富、功能驱动的梯度构式表征，支持构式理论在LLMs中的几何测量。

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

### [8] [Intent Recognition and Out-of-Scope Detection using LLMs in Multi-party Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22289)
*Galo Castillo-López,Gaël de Chalendar,Nasredine Semmar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合BERT和LLM的混合方法，用于零样本和少样本场景下的意图识别和OOS检测，提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务导向对话系统需要大量标注数据，而本文旨在利用BERT的计算效率和LLM的泛化能力解决这一问题。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合BERT和LLM在零样本和少样本设置下进行意图识别和OOS检测，并通过共享BERT输出信息优化LLM性能。

Result: 在多轮对话语料库上评估，结果显示系统性能有所提升。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效利用了BERT和LLM的优势，在意图识别和OOS检测任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

### [9] [A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Negation for NLP and Neural Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22337)
*Roxana Petcu,Samarth Bhargav,Maarten de Rijke,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了否定在神经信息检索和LLM模型中的表现，提出了否定分类法、生成基准数据集，并提出逻辑分类机制以改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂推理任务中的否定问题，提升神经信息检索模型在否定查询中的表现。

Method: 1. 提出否定分类法；2. 生成两个基准数据集；3. 提出逻辑分类机制分析模型性能。

Result: 分类法平衡了数据分布，提升了训练效率；分类机制揭示了现有数据集对否定类型的覆盖情况。

Conclusion: 提出的方法改进了模型对否定的处理能力，并提供了对数据集覆盖的深入分析。

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

### [10] [Traits Run Deep: Enhancing Personality Assessment via Psychology-Guided LLM Representations and Multimodal Apparent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22367)
*Jia Li,Yichao He,Jiacheng Xu,Tianhao Luo,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Traits Run Deep的新型人格评估框架，通过心理学提示和多模态融合技术提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格评估在情感智能、心理健康诊断等领域至关重要，但传统方法难以建模人格语义和实现跨模态理解。

Method: 框架结合心理学提示引导LLMs提取人格语义，设计文本中心的多模态融合网络，包括降维、跨模态连接和文本增强模块。

Result: 在AVI验证集上MSE降低约45%，并在AVI Challenge 2025测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: Traits Run Deep通过创新方法显著提升了人格评估的准确性和跨模态融合效果。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

### [11] [PATENTWRITER: A Benchmarking Study for Patent Drafting with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22387)
*Homaira Huda Shomee,Suman Kalyan Maity,Sourav Medya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PATENTWRITER框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）改进专利摘要生成，评估了六种主流LLMs的性能，并展示了其在生成高质量专利摘要上的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利撰写过程繁琐，本文旨在通过LLMs实现专利写作的范式转变，简化流程。

Method: 提出PATENTWRITER框架，评估六种LLMs（如GPT-4、LLaMA-3）在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现，使用多种指标（如BLEU、ROUGE）和下游任务验证。

Result: 实验表明，现代LLMs能生成高保真且风格合适的专利摘要，优于领域特定基线。

Conclusion: PATENTWRITER框架展示了LLMs在专利摘要生成中的潜力，代码和数据集已开源以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过内容互动评估阅读理解能力在阅读学习过程中至关重要，尤其是针对K-2英语学习者。

Method: 提出一种新方法，生成多样化且难度可调的问题，确保全面覆盖学习内容，并基于FairytaleQA数据集评估语言模型表现。

Result: 方法能够生成多样且适应学习者能力的问题，有望成为自主AI英语教学工具的重要组成部分。

Conclusion: 该方法为K-2英语学习者提供了有效的阅读理解评估工具，展示了AI在教学中的潜力。

Abstract: Assessment of reading comprehension through content-based interactions plays
an important role in the reading acquisition process. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach for generating comprehension questions geared to K-2 English
learners. Our method ensures complete coverage of the underlying material and
adaptation to the learner's specific proficiencies, and can generate a large
diversity of question types at various difficulty levels to ensure a thorough
evaluation. We evaluate the performance of various language models in this
framework using the FairytaleQA dataset as the source material. Eventually, the
proposed approach has the potential to become an important part of autonomous
AI-driven English instructors.

### [13] [NeedleChain: Measuring Intact Long-Context Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22411)
*Hyeonseok Moon,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出NIAH基准可能高估LLMs的长上下文理解能力，并提出新基准NeedleChain和改进策略ROPE Contraction。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NIAH基准可能无法准确评估LLMs的真实长上下文理解能力，需更全面的测试方法。

Method: 引入NeedleChain基准，完全由查询相关信息组成，并提出ROPE Contraction策略。

Result: 实验显示先进LLMs处理大上下文与完全理解能力存在显著差距。

Conclusion: NeedleChain和ROPE Contraction为评估和提升LLMs长上下文理解能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hyeonseokk/NeedleChain

### [14] [AI-generated stories favour stability over change: homogeneity and cultural stereotyping in narratives generated by gpt-4o-mini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22445)
*Jill Walker Rettberg,Hermann Wigers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于英美文本训练的语言模型生成的跨文化故事存在叙事同质化问题，偏向稳定与传统，缺乏多样性和冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能生成具有文化相关性的故事，揭示AI叙事中的潜在偏见。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini为236个国家各生成50个故事，分析其叙事结构和主题。

Result: 故事普遍呈现单一叙事结构，强调传统与社区，缺乏现实冲突和多样性。

Conclusion: AI生成的叙事同质化是一种新型偏见，需在文化对齐和AI研究中加以关注。

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

TL;DR: Falcon-H1是一种新型混合架构大语言模型系列，结合Transformer和状态空间模型（SSM），在性能和效率上表现卓越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统模型在长上下文记忆和计算效率上的不足，同时优化模型设计和训练策略。

Method: 采用并行混合架构，结合Transformer和SSM，并优化数据策略和训练动态。

Result: Falcon-H1在多个参数规模下表现优异，旗舰34B模型性能媲美更大规模模型，且支持256K上下文和多语言任务。

Conclusion: Falcon-H1系列模型在性能、效率和适用性上均处于领先地位，并通过开源许可推动AI研究的可及性。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

### [16] [What is an "Abstract Reasoner"? Revisiting Experiments and Arguments about Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22457)
*Tian Yun,Chen Sun,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具备抽象推理能力，通过实验表明零样本性能虽差，但微调部分参数可显著提升表现，但泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳LLMs不具备抽象推理能力的观点，通过实验验证其潜力与局限性。

Method: 在零样本和微调设置下测试LLMs性能，并分析其跨数据集泛化能力。

Result: 微调少量参数可实现接近完美性能，但泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 需重新定义‘抽象推理’，并讨论LLMs是否符合标准的意义。

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过前向和后向约束生成的方法，提升代码大语言模型在可控代码生成中的指令遵循能力，并引入了多语言基准IFEvalCode进行更细致的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，代码生成不仅需要正确性，还需严格遵循编码风格、行数和结构等详细要求，现有模型在此方面表现不足。

Method: 采用前向和后向约束生成方法，增强模型对指令的遵循能力，并设计IFEvalCode基准，支持多语言和双指标评估。

Result: 实验表明，闭源模型在可控代码生成上优于开源模型，且模型在生成正确代码和精确遵循指令之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究为提升代码大语言模型的指令遵循能力提供了有效方法，并揭示了模型在可控代码生成中的局限性。

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

TL;DR: 研究通过后训练技术提升小语言模型（SLMs）在Text-to-SQL任务中的表现，验证了方法的有效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管小语言模型（SLMs）在推理速度和边缘部署上有优势，但其在Text-to-SQL任务中表现不佳，研究旨在探索其潜力。

Method: 利用SynSQL-2.5M数据集构建两个子数据集，结合监督微调和强化学习后训练，采用自一致性推理方法。

Result: 在BIRD开发集上，模型平均提升31.4分，0.5B和1.5B模型分别达到56.87%和67.08%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: SLM-SQL方法有效提升了SLMs在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，并展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,
model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

TL;DR: CliCARE框架通过将非结构化电子健康记录转化为时间知识图谱，并结合临床指南，显著提升了大型语言模型在癌症决策支持中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理长时序、多语言电子健康记录时面临的挑战，如临床幻觉和不可靠的评估指标。

Method: 将电子健康记录转化为时间知识图谱，并与指南知识图谱对齐，生成临床总结和建议。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上显著优于基线模型，临床有效性得到专家认可。

Conclusion: CliCARE为癌症决策支持提供了一种高效、可靠的方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

Method: 引入CSConDa数据集（包含9000多个QA对），并对11个轻量级开源ViLLMs进行自动指标和句法分析的综合评估。

Result: 揭示了模型的优缺点及语言模式，为下一代ViLLMs的改进提供了方向。

Conclusion: 通过建立稳健的基准和系统评估，支持客户服务QA的模型选择，并推动越南语大语言模型的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly

TL;DR: ControlMed是一种医疗语言模型，通过精细控制标记允许用户动态调整推理长度，解决了现有LLMs在医疗领域中的计算开销和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗决策需要高可靠性的支持，但现有LLMs生成的推理过程冗长，导致计算开销和延迟，限制了实际应用。

Method: ControlMed通过三阶段训练：1）大规模合成医疗指令数据预训练；2）带多长度推理数据和长度控制标记的监督微调；3）基于模型奖励信号的强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，ControlMed在英语和韩语医疗基准测试中性能与或优于现有模型，且用户可灵活平衡推理准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: ControlMed是一种实用且适应性强的解决方案，适用于临床问答和医疗信息分析。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制易受认知偏差攻击，但多偏差交互的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，生成优化偏差组合的提示词，绕过安全协议。

Result: 在30种LLM中测试，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法（60.1% vs. 31.6%）。

Conclusion: 多偏差交互是未充分探索的攻击向量，为更鲁棒的AI安全机制提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过放大语言特定神经元对多语言模型行为的影响，发现其对低资源语言有益，但对跨语言迁移效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言特定神经元在放大后的作用，尤其是在多语言模型中对低资源语言的影响。

Method: 通过干预18种语言（包括低资源语言）的语言特定神经元，提出LSS评分评估放大效果，并在下游任务中测试。

Result: 放大因子能有效引导输出至目标语言，但对跨语言任务表现通常有负面影响。

Conclusion: 放大语言特定神经元对低资源语言有益，但对跨语言迁移帮助有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Result: BALSAM为阿拉伯语LLM提供了统一标准和协作研究平台。

Conclusion: BALSAM有望推动阿拉伯语LLM的发展，并促进研究合作。

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Motivation: 探索多语言大模型中语言处理的神经机制，尤其是语言特异性神经元的作用。

Method: 使用Language Activation Probability Entropy (LAPE)方法分析神经元，并通过语言算术（激活加减乘除）操控语言行为。

Result: 发现语言特异性神经元集中在深层，非拉丁文字语言表现出更强的特异性；语言操控方法在多语言任务中表现优于简单替换方法。

Conclusion: 神经元操控能有效指导多语言行为，且语言相似性有助于操控效果，同时揭示了语言选择的内部备用机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available

Motivation: 现有研究对LLMs政治偏见的评估局限于少数模型和语言，且未探讨其可控性，本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 评估了7个模型（如LLaMA-3.1、Qwen-3）在14种语言中的政治倾向，采用政治罗盘测试及11种语义等价表述确保测量稳健性，并测试了干预技术的效果。

Result: 更大模型普遍偏向自由左翼立场，且不同语言和模型家族间存在显著差异；干预技术能有效操控模型的政治立场。

Conclusion: LLMs的政治偏见具有普遍性和可控性，为未来研究和应用提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: 该框架通过捕捉显性和隐性线索，实现了全面且无偏的面试评估，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

Result: 在四个多跳QA数据集上，TIRESRAG-R1优于现有RAG方法，并能泛化到单跳任务。

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1显著提升了RAG方法的推理能力和稳定性，为复杂任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data

Result: 汉语中幻觉最少，印地语和波斯语中幻觉显著更多。

Conclusion: 需针对不同语言优化LLM以减少幻觉，尤其是印地语和波斯语。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often
generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of
hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本生成中表现出色，但其向量池化会丢失关键信息，而许多非生成任务（如聚类、分类或检索）需要精确的文本嵌入。

Method: 采用三种策略：(i) 词嵌入聚合技术，(ii) 任务特定提示工程，(iii) 对比微调增强文本表示。

Result: 在MTEB的英文聚类任务中达到最优性能，微调后注意力更集中于语义相关词。

Conclusion: 结合提示工程和对比微调，LLMs可高效适配为文本嵌入模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically

*Praveenkumar Katwe,Rakesh Chandra,Balabantaray Kali,Prasad Vittala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于奖励驱动的微调框架，通过优化实体幻觉指数（EHI）来减少生成摘要中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少抽象摘要中的幻觉问题是语言模型在实际应用中的关键挑战。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型生成基线摘要，通过自动实体提取和匹配计算EHI分数，并利用强化学习微调模型参数，以EHI作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集上均能提升EHI，显著减少实体级幻觉且不影响流畅性或信息量。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工标注，可扩展性强，为基于轻量级幻觉指标的模型微调提供了可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

*Jindřich Libovický,Jindřich Helcl,Andrei Manea,Gianluca Vico*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多模态（文本和视觉）的开放式区域问答基准，并基于先进的大语言模型（LLMs）提供了基线。数据集包含人工标注的问题和答案，评估发现LLMs在区域知识上存在显著差距，且自动评估指标与人工判断相关性低。

Motivation: 填补开放式区域问答领域的空白，评估LLMs的区域知识能力，并研究跨语言生成一致性和评估指标的改进。

Method: 构建基于Wikipedia的多语言数据集，通过LLMs和人工评估对比分析自动评估指标的可靠性。

Result: LLMs在区域知识上表现不足，自动评估指标与人工判断相关性低。

Conclusion: 该数据集可用于评估LLMs的区域知识、研究跨语言一致性，并推动开放式问答评估指标的发展。

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and
agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling.
However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit

present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，通过分阶段推理（结构化规划、图执行、摘要生成）改进查询聚焦表摘要的可靠性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言计划存在模糊性和缺乏结构的问题，限制了其转换为可执行程序（如SQL）的能力，尤其是在多表任务中。

Method: 引入结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，分三阶段：结构化规划生成TaSoF，图执行转换为SQL并建模依赖关系，摘要生成。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中，SPaGe在单表和多表任务中均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 结构化表示显著提升了查询聚焦表摘要的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL中未被研究的位置偏差，揭示演示位置对模型预测和准确性的影响。

Method: 设计系统评估流程，引入ACCURACY-CHANGE和PREDICTION-CHANGE指标，在多个任务和模型上测试。

Result: 演示位置显著影响模型性能，起始位置表现最佳（准确率提升6%），而末尾位置可能导致预测翻转（30%）。

Conclusion: DPP偏差普遍存在，小型模型受影响更大，但大型模型在复杂任务中仍受轻微影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

Conclusion: 研究为物理引擎故障检测提供了新见解和资源，支持未来研究改进物理引擎的可靠性。

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对T2I和I2I生成模型在多维度（如质量、对齐、多样性等）上复杂权衡的探索，主要由于数据集和评估指标的不足。

Method: 提出TRIG-Bench数据集和TRIGScore评估指标，开发Relation Recognition System生成DTM，评估14个模型并分析其维度权衡。

Conclusion: TRIG-Bench和DTM为生成模型的评估和优化提供了新工具，揭示了模型在多维度上的表现和优化潜力。

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

Motivation: 传统元学习方法忽视颜色信息，而人类颜色感知对学习至关重要，因此提出模拟颜色感知机制以改进少样本学习。

Method: 提出ColorSense Learner框架，利用颜色通道特征提取和交互学习；引入ColorSense Distiller通过知识蒸馏增强学习能力。

Result: 在11个少样本基准测试中表现优异，具有强泛化性、鲁棒性和迁移能力。

Conclusion: 颜色感知机制显著提升少样本学习性能，为元学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

Motivation: 儿童脑肿瘤（PBTs）的多样性和异质性给诊断和治疗带来挑战，深度学习分割技术有望提供解决方案。

Method: 使用174例儿童患者的MRI数据（T1、T1-C、T2、FLAIR序列），训练3D nnU-Net模型，评估其在四种肿瘤子区域的分割性能。

Result: 模型在整体肿瘤和T2高信号区域表现稳健（DSC 0.85），与人工标注相当；增强肿瘤和囊性成分分割效果较差。

Conclusion: 深度学习适用于儿童脑肿瘤分割，但需进一步优化，尤其是增强肿瘤和囊性成分的分割。支持简化MRI协议和自动化工作流程。

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg为无监督地形分割提供了高效且时间一致的解决方案，适用于未知环境。

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames
to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human
supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark
datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform
unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

Conclusion: SmartCLIP通过灵活对齐和表示分离，显著提升了跨模态对齐的效果，为下游任务提供了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

Conclusion: HOG-CNN是轻量级、可解释的模型，适用于资源有限的临床环境，为自动化筛查提供可靠工具。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测数据丰富但高质量标签稀缺，需要高效模型将稀疏标签转化为地图。

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected
around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort
required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to
considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels
into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model
yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial,
temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a
diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a
dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017
through 2024.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像重建中非凸非光滑优化问题，结合残差学习和交替最小化算法，提升重建性能。

Method: 提出LAMA算法，结合残差学习和近端交替框架，证明其收敛性，并扩展为LAMA-Net和iLAMA-Net。

Result: LAMA-Net表现出优异的稳定性和鲁棒性，iLAMA-Net进一步提升了性能，实验验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: LAMA及其网络扩展在图像重建中具有高效性和稳定性，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

*Yuzhen Gao,Qianqian Wang,Yongheng Sun,Cui Wang,Yongquan Liang,Mingxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作域适应（CDA）框架，结合ViT和CNN，用于通过T1加权MRI检测晚年抑郁症（LLD），解决了样本量小和域异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法因样本量小和域异质性（如成像协议、扫描硬件和人口统计差异）而受限，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: CDA框架分三阶段：源数据监督训练、目标特征自监督适应、未标记目标数据协作训练，结合ViT和CNN提取全局与局部特征。

Result: 在多站点T1加权MRI数据上的实验表明，CDA优于现有无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: CDA框架有效提升了LLD检测的域适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法对不利视角的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了模型在不利视角下的表现，扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Conclusion: RSICA范式及DeltaVLM模型为遥感图像变化分析提供了高效、交互式的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large
language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize
efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset
and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

Method: 提出FaceGCD方法，利用轻量级层前缀动态构建特征提取器，通过HyperNetwork自适应生成前缀。

Result: FaceGCD在GFD任务中显著优于现有GCD方法和ArcFace基准，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceGCD为开放世界人脸识别提供了有效解决方案，推动了AGI的发展。

Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a
critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper
introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with
large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and

the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video
distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features,
ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video
datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

Result: 在VGAF-GEMS基准测试中，GEMS框架在定量和定性比较中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: GEMS为情绪分析提供了更细粒度和全面的方法，推动了相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLMs在频率域扰动下的脆弱性，挑战其可靠性。

Method: 设计频率域的目标图像变换，测试五种先进VLM模型。

Result: VLMs对频率扰动敏感，输出与语义内容不完全一致。

Conclusion: VLMs在多模态感知任务中的可靠性需进一步优化。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

Result: MINR在域内和域外场景均优于MAE，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是现有框架的鲁棒高效替代方案，适用于多种自监督学习任务。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Conclusion: MZNet是一种高效实用的摩尔纹去除解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive
structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant
obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and
industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning
algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural
networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these
efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

Conclusion: UAVScenes填补了多模态无人机数据集的空白，为高级场景理解任务提供了基准。

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Motivation: 探索如何通过LVLMs提升图像-文本对数据的质量，实现自我增强的循环改进。

Method: 利用LVLMs处理图像和原始文本，生成四种互补的文本标注，并扩展对比学习范式以纳入负描述和短标签作为监督信号。

Conclusion: 通过LVLM驱动的数据优化和训练范式改进，显著提升了模型性能，展示了自我增强循环的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success
of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision
encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language
models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:
Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用事件相机进行域适应的方法，以解决运动模糊对姿态估计的影响，无需目标域标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊和低光条件导致姿态估计性能下降，现有数据集假设稳定条件，模型在模糊环境中表现不佳。

Method: 使用事件相机生成运动感知模糊图像，结合师生框架和互不确定性掩码迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 方法在运动模糊环境下优于传统域适应方法，无需目标域标注即可实现鲁棒姿态估计。

Conclusion: 事件相机为真实世界运动模糊环境中的域适应提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

Conclusion: TopoLiDM在LiDAR场景生成中表现出色，兼具高效性和可扩展性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有任务驱动图像恢复方法在多复杂退化场景下难以恢复任务相关细节的问题。

Method: 提出EDTR方法，通过从像素误差预恢复的低质量图像生成并添加轻度噪声，结合少量去噪步骤，避免冗余细节干扰。

Result: EDTR显著提升了多复杂退化场景下的任务性能和视觉质量。

Conclusion: EDTR有效利用扩散先验，为任务驱动图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address
performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

Motivation: 现有方法在无监督视频对象分割（UVOS）中过度依赖高层语义特征，导致缺乏细粒度信息，影响了分割精度。

Method: 提出分层记忆架构，结合浅层和高层特征，并设计异构交互机制（PLAM和SGIM模块）实现像素与语义信息的互补。

Conclusion: HMHI-Net通过分层记忆和异构交互机制，显著提升了无监督视频对象分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

Result: 零样本模型表现优于现有方法，InstructBLIP架构在DFDC-P数据集上显著优于传统分类器。

Conclusion: VLM在深度伪造检测中优于传统方法，展示了零样本学习的潜力。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: CamFlow通过混合基表示和概率损失，为2D相机运动估计提供了更通用和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

Result: 实验证明SSGformer在多天气图像恢复中表现优越，能有效处理复杂退化。

Conclusion: SSGformer通过结合频谱分解和分组注意力，显著提升了多天气图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our
code is available at:

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our

Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定提示或共享空间生成的提示，限制了提示的表示多样性，难以满足复杂任务需求。

Method: 提出提示演化机制，自适应聚合任务特定提示，并通过可学习概率门决定激活哪些层。

Result: 在图像分类和视频动作识别任务中，平均性能提升9.07%和7.40%。

Conclusion: 提示演化机制有效提升了持续学习中提示的多样性和任务适应性。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺病变亚型的准确识别对个性化治疗至关重要，但超声图像数据分布不均（长尾分布）给自动识别带来挑战。

Method: 采用双阶段框架，结合强化学习自适应采样器动态调整合成与真实数据比例，并通过类可控合成网络保持类别特征。

Result: 在内部长尾和公共不平衡乳腺超声数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解数据分布偏差，提升分类性能，为长尾问题提供新思路。

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: COOkeD通过结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探针分类器，实现了卓越的OOD检测性能，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统OOD检测方法性能受限于单一分类器的问题，提出一种异构集成方法以提升检测能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 创建异构集成模型COOkeD，结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探针分类器。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了最先进的OOD检测性能，并表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD通过模块化和后验集成方法，显著提升了OOD检测性能，且引入的开销较小。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

Conclusion: PCuRL框架有效提升了多模态推理模型的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有基于反向传播的方法因计算成本高和梯度爆炸风险，难以实现完整的梯度反向传播，导致结果不佳。

Result: 实验证明ShortFT能有效应用于多种奖励函数，显著提升对齐性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShortFT通过缩短去噪链，高效优化扩散模型，显著提升奖励对齐效果。

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证，显著提升长尾样本性能并增强头部样本准确性。

Conclusion: GALTraj首次将生成式主动学习应用于轨迹预测，有效解决长尾问题且不改变模型结构。

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing

Result: LOTS在全局与局部指标上达到最先进的生成性能，并通过定性分析与用户评估验证其设计定制化能力。

Conclusion: LOTS为时尚设计提供了一种高效的草图-文本生成框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

Result: 方法比现有最佳无监督SfT快400倍，且在细节生成和遮挡处理上表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文方法在速度和性能上显著优于现有技术，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI have made video-level deepfake detection
increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection
techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level
Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by
the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale
audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level
deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples,
thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features
an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual
interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under
the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware
cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised
singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive
experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation
studies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components.
Remarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the

Abstract: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for
applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and
SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching,
exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep
learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth
images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language
interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and
descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate
intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps.
Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free
strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially
improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight
modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors
for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds,
attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions
like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal
applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language
tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly
diverse data interactions.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical
challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and
tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled
with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.
The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven
segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these
advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods
for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and
future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information
(past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from
the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation
mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In
doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to
the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also
discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and
trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error
accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for
future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the
field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of
VOST through the lens of foundation models.

Method: 基于FetalCLIP模型，采用LoRA微调技术开发FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$，并在ACOUSLIC-AI数据集上与多种基线模型对比。

Result: FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$取得最高F1分数0.757，改进后的分割模型进一步将F1分数提升至0.771。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调技术可提升胎儿超声基础模型的任务适应性，推动资源有限地区的产前护理发展。

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLLMs在复杂视觉信息处理和模态桥接上存在高成本和效率不足的问题。

Method: 整合CLIP、SigLIP等四种视觉骨干网络提取互补特征，采用稀疏专家连接器（MoECs）动态选择专家，并设计分层组注意力（HGA）优化特征利用。

Result: MoCHA在多个基准测试中优于现有模型，如POPE提升3.25%，MME提升153分。

Conclusion: MoCHA通过MoECs和HGA模块有效提升了性能，证明了其设计的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

Motivation: 深度神经网络易受特洛伊木马攻击，现有触发器反演方法缺乏对触发器真实性的保证，需改进。

Method: 采用扩散生成器和目标分类器引导，迭代生成候选触发器，限制搜索空间并避免强假设。

Result: DISTIL在BackdoorBench数据集上准确率提升7.1%，在特洛伊目标检测模型扫描中提升9.4%。

Conclusion: DISTIL为无需大量数据或强先验假设的可靠后门防御提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

Result: 在单类和二分类任务中表现优异，对未见生成器有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效提升了AI生成人脸的检测性能。

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将深度用于推理阶段的物体布局估计，未能充分利用其几何信息。DepR旨在通过深度引导在训练和推理中全面利用深度信息。

Method: DepR采用深度引导条件化，将形状先验编码到扩散模型中，并在推理阶段通过深度引导DDIM采样和布局优化提升重建精度。

Result: DepR在合成和真实数据集上均表现出色，实现了单视角场景重建的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DepR通过深度信息的全面利用，显著提升了单视角场景重建的效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在布局准确性、结构连贯性和代码正确性上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了UI到代码的生成效果，还通过数据引擎扩展了开源VLM的性能。

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available

TL;DR: CapRecover是一种跨模态反演框架，直接从中间特征恢复高级语义内容（如标签或描述），避免图像重建，解决了视觉语言模型中的语义信息泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在分体式DNN配置中的部署增加，中间特征的语义信息泄漏风险上升，现有图像重建方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出CapRecover框架，直接从中间特征恢复语义内容，并通过添加随机噪声保护隐私。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上Top-1标签准确率达92.71%，COCO2017上ROUGE-L得分为0.52；噪声保护方法有效。

Conclusion: CapRecover能高效恢复语义信息，噪声保护方法简单且无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

Conclusion: TR-PTS通过任务驱动的参数和令牌选择，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Result: LCS在五项指标上优于AMD的EASF和FSR1，具有更好的感知质量。

Conclusion: LCS展示了高效超分辨率模型在资源受限设备上的潜力。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Conclusion: OmniAVS和OISA为多模态音频视觉分割提供了新基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant
advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and
deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the
boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose
Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset
containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS
stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions
that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on
understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the
inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,
we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the
challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of
audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and
perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA
outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on
other related tasks.
