TL;DR: Gemini 2.X模型家族（包括2.5 Pro、2.5 Flash、2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite）在性能与成本之间实现了全面覆盖，2.5 Pro在多模态理解和长上下文处理上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动前沿编码和推理基准的性能，同时满足不同计算和延迟需求。

Method: 开发Gemini 2.X系列模型，包括高性能的2.5 Pro和低成本的2.5 Flash、2.0 Flash及Flash-Lite。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在多模态理解和长上下文任务上达到SoTA性能，2.5 Flash在低计算需求下提供优秀推理能力。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.X系列模型在性能与成本之间实现了平衡，为复杂代理工作流提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute
and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

### [2] [Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306)

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中存在过度自信和用户过度依赖的问题，不同语言中不确定性标记的使用和解读差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在全球范围内的安全性，尤其是其在不同语言中的校准问题，以避免用户对模型生成的过度依赖。

Method: 分析五种语言中LLM生成的认识标记分布，并测量用户在不同语言中对模型生成的依赖行为。

Result: LLMs在所有语言中均表现出过度自信，但能感知语言差异；用户在不同语言中对模型生成的依赖行为存在差异。

Conclusion: 多语言校准具有挑战性，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

### [3] [ETT: Expanding the Long Context Understanding Capability of LLMs at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06313)
*Kiarash Zahirnia,Zahra Golpayegani,Walid Ahmad,Yang Liu*

TL;DR: ETT方法通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度，提升模型在长序列任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的计算和内存开销随序列长度呈二次增长，限制了其在长序列处理中的应用。

Method: ETT通过在测试时对输入上下文进行分块微调，扩展上下文长度，重点优化FFN的第二层。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: ETT有效解决了长序列处理问题，且部分模块微调比全微调效果更好。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Conclusion: “词作为分类器”模型为统一形式、分布和接地语义理论提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估分词器质量的有效方法尚不明确，尤其是分词器是否保留语言学上有意义的子词。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，并与五种预训练语言模型在七项任务中的性能进行相关性分析。

Result: 形态对齐对模型性能的方差解释较少，表明其单独不足以衡量分词器质量。

Conclusion: 形态对齐并非衡量分词器质量的关键维度，需结合其他因素评估。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

TL;DR: PERK是一种参数高效的方法，通过梯度更新轻量级适配器在测试时编码长上下文，显著优于传统提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文推理中噪声信息处理和内存密集型元学习方法的问题。

Method: 采用双嵌套优化循环，内循环快速编码上下文到低秩适配器，外循环学习使用适配器进行推理。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，小模型提升90%，大模型提升27%，且对推理复杂性、长度外推和信息位置更鲁棒。

Conclusion: PERK在训练时内存密集，但推理时比提示方法更高效。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

Motivation: 由于人类偏好的复杂性和数据集的局限性，奖励模型在分布偏移或对抗扰动下容易失效，而现有方法依赖先验知识，实用性受限。

Method: 提出了一种不依赖偏好分布的方法，通过奖励引导的解码发现失败模式，并利用REFORM框架生成对抗样本以增强训练数据。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上，REFORM显著提升了鲁棒性，同时保持了奖励质量和对齐性能。

Conclusion: REFORM通过自我改进机制有效提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐质量，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

Conclusion: LLM分解方法提高了透明性和性能，为优化模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解政策语言的演变对评估全球应对复杂挑战（如气候变化）至关重要，但传统方法效率低且难以捕捉复杂关联。

Method: 使用动态嵌入主题模型（DETM）分析1995年至2023年UNFCCC政策决策的语料库，揭示主题的时序动态。

Result: 模型显示政策焦点从早期的温室气体和国际公约转向近期的实施、技术合作、能力建设和全球协议。

Conclusion: DETM是一种可扩展且有效的工具，未来可扩展至其他政策领域。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

Conclusion: PAPO为强化学习框架提供了感知感知监督的深度集成，为视觉基础推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

Conclusion: 该方法为时间归一化提供了新的解决方案，兼具实用性和性能优势。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

Method: 系统评估多种线性注意力模型，训练并开源72个模型，涵盖不同参数规模和混合比例。

Result: 发现独立线性模型在混合架构中表现不一定优秀，召回性能随全注意力层增加而显著提升。

Conclusion: 推荐使用HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet架构，线性与全注意力比例在3:1至6:1之间，以实现高效召回性能。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

Result: 实验表明，SpindleKV在减少KV缓存的同时，保持了模型性能，甚至优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SpindleKV有效解决了KV缓存冗余问题，为LLM推理系统提供了高效的内存优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

Conclusion: InvestAlign是一种有前景的方法，可解决复杂投资问题并实现LLM与投资者决策行为的对齐。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

Method: 通过聚类分析、GPT-4/GPT-3.5标注关键信息、数据增强（生成新文本）构建高质量数据集，并微调大语言模型。

Result: 模型在保证高召回率和精度的同时提升了解析效率，LoRA、数据平衡和数据增强显著提高了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业合同信息提取任务提供了新颖高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

### [19] [The Flaws of Others: An LLM-driven Framework for Scientific Knowledge Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06565)
*Juan B. Gutiérrez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将人类与大型语言模型（LLM）视为平等节点的网络模型，分析了信息流通中的无效性问题，并提出了通过同行评审提升系统真实性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索人类与LLM交互中的信息流通问题，特别是无效性（如事实、逻辑或结构错误）及其对系统稳定性的影响。

Method: 方法包括构建一个网络模型，分析无效性的四种危害（偏离真相、自我修复、新造内容、外部检测），并提出FOO算法作为同行评审的解决方案。

Result: 结果显示，仅依赖偏离和自我修复的网络会稳定在中等错误率，而加入新造内容会重现当前LLM的高错误率；同行评审能显著提升系统真实性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，提升新媒介的可靠性需通过将不完美模型整合到相互监督的网络中，而非追求单一模型的完美。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多模态知识图谱（MMKG）与生成式AI的食品领域QA框架，显著提升了性能与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品领域QA中知识整合与多模态生成的挑战，提升回答的可靠性与多样性。

Method: 构建大规模MMKG，生成QA对，联合微调Meta LLaMA和Stable Diffusion模型，采用混合检索-生成策略。

Result: BERTScore提升16.2%，FID降低37.8%，CLIP对齐提升31.1%，图像重用准确率94.1%，合成充分性85%。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与多模态生成结合显著提升食品QA的可靠性与多样性。

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and
multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gated Memory Unit (GMU)的机制，用于在SSM层之间高效共享内存，并基于此构建了SambaY架构，显著提升了解码效率和长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未探索SSM层间表示共享的效率潜力，因此作者提出GMU机制以填补这一空白。

Method: 引入GMU机制，构建SambaY架构，结合Samba自解码器和跨解码器，共享内存读取状态。

Result: SambaY显著提升解码效率，保持线性预填充复杂度，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。最大模型在推理任务中性能优于基线，且解码吞吐量提升10倍。

Conclusion: GMU机制和SambaY架构在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，展示了大规模计算下的优越扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

TL;DR: FuDoBa是一种基于贝叶斯优化的方法，结合LLM嵌入与领域知识，生成低维、任务相关的表示，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的高维嵌入在领域应用中过于通用或低效的问题。

Method: 融合LLM嵌入与领域知识（本地和外部如WikiData），通过贝叶斯优化生成低维表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于或媲美专有LLM嵌入基线。

Conclusion: FuDoBa能有效生成高效、可解释的表示，适用于领域特定任务。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据提取阶段资源密集，研究者希望通过在线大语言模型（LLMs）和审查协议提高效率。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并评估其性能。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据提取准确率低（9.6%和15.8%）。总体精确度高（>90%），但召回率和F1分数低（<25%和<40%）。

Conclusion: 基于审查协议的方法需要更全面的性能评估，建议研究者在类似应用中评估并报告LLM性能。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究精英极化现象，通过分析政治人物在议会演讲中的互动和情感温度，量化党派间的敌对程度。

Method: 利用人工智能检测议会演讲中的发言者和被提及者，评估情感温度，构建精英极化指数。

Result: 指数对选举活动、政党危机等事件反应良好，展示了较高的表面效度。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来欧盟范围内的精英极化研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床文本生成中数据非结构化和语义密集的问题，提升生成文本的临床相关性和实用性。

Method: 提出CLI-RAG框架，采用分层分块策略和双阶段检索机制（全局阶段识别相关笔记类型，局部阶段提取高价值内容）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，生成的结构化进度笔记平均对齐分数达87.7%，优于临床医生撰写的笔记（80.7%），且生成结果在LLMs间高度一致。

Conclusion: CLI-RAG框架有效提升了临床文本生成的质量和可靠性，为实际应用提供了可复现且可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

Motivation: 研究LLMs内部如何表示和处理预测的不确定性，以检测不确定性并防止幻觉。

Method: 使用Tuned Lens（Logit Lens的变体）分析11个数据集和5个模型的层间概率轨迹，比较确定性和不确定性预测的动态。

Result: 确定性和不确定性预测的轨迹高度一致，且置信度在相似层突然增加；更优秀的模型可能以不同方式处理不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了利用简单方法检测不确定性的可行性，并展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

Method: 比较随机与fastText嵌入（静态和微调），使用CBOW和Skip-gram模型，结合CNN和CNN-KAN基线，并测试MLP和KAN分类头。

Result: KAConvText-MLP结合微调fastText嵌入表现最佳，准确率分别为91.23%（仇恨言论）、92.66%（新闻分类）和99.82%（语言识别）。

Conclusion: KAConvText在多种句子分类任务中表现出色，尤其是结合微调嵌入和MLP分类头时。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution
for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks:
imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%

Result: 在多语言和多个基准数据集上表现优于基线，接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: CE-Judge是一种高效、低成本的多语言文本评估解决方案。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

Method: 采用DACP方法对多种基础模型和服务领域进行持续预训练，并通过实验和实际评估验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，应用DACP的sLLMs在目标领域性能显著提升，同时保持了通用能力。

Conclusion: DACP方法为sLLMs提供了一种经济高效且可扩展的企业级部署方案。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合顺序和并行推理的优势，提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于段落个体相关性重排序，难以满足复杂查询（如多跳问答）的信息需求。

Method: 提出SETR方法，通过Chain-of-Thought推理识别查询需求，并选择最优段落集合。

Result: 在多跳RAG基准测试中，SETR在答案正确性和检索质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SETR为RAG系统提供了一种高效且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

implementing and maintaining AI evaluations and develop solutions including:
(1) a structured cohort management framework for scaling community

cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and
community coordination beyond traditional software development practices.

TL;DR: SCoRE是一种模块化、低成本的句子级关系抽取系统，支持灵活切换预训练语言模型，无需微调，适应性强，并在噪声标注数据下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低监督环境下关系抽取的需求，提供适应性强且抗噪声的解决方案，同时与预训练语言模型无缝集成。

Method: 结合监督对比学习和贝叶斯k近邻分类器进行多标签分类，提出两个新评估指标（CSD和P@R），并发布Wiki20d基准数据集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于或匹配现有方法，显著降低能耗，模型复杂度增加会降低性能。

Conclusion: SCoRE结合高效性、模块化和可扩展性，是现实世界关系抽取应用的理想选择。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

TL;DR: GUI代理基于大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）实现人机交互自动化，但视觉定位可能引入后门攻击漏洞。论文提出VisualTrap方法，验证了仅需5%有毒数据即可有效攻击，且攻击具有跨环境泛化能力。

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过注入有毒数据误导视觉定位，攻击代理行为。

Result: 实验显示，仅需5%有毒数据即可高效攻击，且攻击具有跨任务和环境泛化能力。

Conclusion: GUI代理的后门攻击风险亟需进一步研究。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/destroy-lonely/MIND.

Conclusion: 研究为法律判决预测提供了新数据集和基准，揭示了多被告多指控场景的复杂性。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Method: 使用两个数学辅导对话数据集，测试Llama 3和GPT-4o在预测导师策略和学生表现上的能力。

Result: 即使最先进的LLMs也难以准确预测导师策略，但导师策略对学生表现有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法来提升导师策略预测的准确性。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

Motivation: 当前代码生成评估基准（如HumanEval和LiveCodeBench）的测试用例数量有限且同质化，导致性能评估不准确，影响强化学习框架中的奖励估计。

Method: 提出多维度指标量化测试套件的全面性，并引入人机协作方法SAGA，结合人类编程经验和LLM推理能力，提升测试用例的覆盖率和质量。

Result: SAGA在TCGBench上的检测率达到90.62%，验证准确性为32.58%，优于LiveCodeBench-v6。

Conclusion: SAGA方法为可靠的LLM代码评估提供了可扩展的基础，推动了代码生成中的强化学习奖励估计，并为自动化对抗测试合成和自适应基准集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

Result: 检索器性能在轻微查询变化下显著下降，实验结果为RAG系统提供了实用建议。

Conclusion: RAG系统对查询质量敏感，需改进检索器鲁棒性，提出的评估框架和实验结果对实践者有指导意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为敏感数据行业提供解决方案，支持数据本地化与细粒度访问控制，同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

Conclusion: 离散扩散模型在自然语言生成中展现出潜力，尤其是在并行生成方面，但仍需在生成质量上进一步改进。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过结合CLIP感知和课程对比正则化，有效解决了水下图像增强中的感知质量和内容恢复问题。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

Conclusion: SPARC为跨模型和模态的概念比较提供了直接方法，并支持实际应用如文本引导的空间定位。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at

Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林中的流体流动）需要精确的表面几何和不确定性量化，现有方法缺乏几何集成，导致不确定性图校准不佳。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为不确定性感知的3D场景重建、模拟和机器人决策奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），解决了多模态模型在分割和理解任务中的不准确和幻觉问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型（LMMs）在分割和理解任务中存在不准确分割和幻觉理解的局限性，主要源于视觉理解能力弱和缺乏细粒度感知。

Method: 提出LIRA框架，包含SEFE（融合语义和像素级特征以提升分割精度）和ILVC（通过局部描述生成提供细粒度监督）。同时引入AttrEval数据集量化语义推理能力。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合视觉理解和分割的互补关系，有效解决了现有模型的局限性，并展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,

and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CCPDA的数据增强方法，通过集中复制粘贴火源区域来提升多类分割模型的性能，特别针对火源类别的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野火科学领域因标注数据稀缺和高成本导致的分割模型训练困难问题。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三步：识别火源簇、集中处理火源核心区域、将处理后的火源粘贴到目标图像上。

Result: CCPDA显著提升了火源类别的分割性能，优于其他数据增强方法。

Conclusion: CCPDA有效缓解了小型标注数据集带来的训练挑战，尤其在火源分割任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊等）下性能显著下降，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: AR2通过对齐干净和损坏图像的类激活图（CAMs），采用迭代修复策略（CAM引导细化与标准微调交替），提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: AR2在标准损坏基准测试中表现优于现有方法，同时保持干净数据的准确性。

Conclusion: AR2为提升模型在多样化损坏环境中的可靠性提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for

Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of

Method: 提出PCL-Former，包含三个专用Transformer模块：Proposal-Former（候选段识别）、Classification-Former（动作分类）和Localization-Former（边界预测）。

Result: 在THUMOS14、ActivityNet-1.3和HACS数据集上分别超越现有方法2.8%、1.2%和4.8%。

Conclusion: PCL-Former通过模块化设计和专用损失函数，显著提升了时序动作定位的性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS

TL;DR: THOR是一种实时自适应时空RGB帧采样方法，利用热传感技术捕捉手部活动，显著减少数据处理量和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决穿戴式相机连续处理RGB图像的高能耗、大数据量和隐私问题。

Method: 结合低分辨率热感数据动态调整RGB帧采样率，并利用热信号定位手部活动区域以减少处理范围。

Result: 仅需3%的原始RGB数据即可实现95%的手部活动识别准确率，与全视频数据（94%）相当。

Conclusion: THOR为穿戴式相机实时监测手部活动提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式视觉系统在高动态环境中存在运动模糊、高延迟和数据冗余问题，事件相机虽能异步捕捉亮度变化，但稀疏和噪声事件流对物体检测提出挑战。

Method: 采用卷积编码的事件自动编码器架构，结合自适应阈值选择和轻量级分类器，优化识别精度并降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，但参数减少35.5倍；在嵌入式平台上实现8-44.8 FPS，性能优于现有方法87.84倍。

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升事件视觉性能，适用于低功耗、高速实时边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和大型语言模型的视频推理方法依赖大规模监督微调和长链思维标注，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 跳过资源密集的监督微调步骤，采用纯强化学习训练和稀疏到密集的视频测试时间缩放策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅用3.6%的训练样本即超越现有模型平均2.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频缩放策略，实现了高效且高性能的视频推理。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在2D特征提取上表现不足，尤其是在目标被遮挡或场景复杂时，RGB信息有限。

Method: 利用2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外模态信息，结合RGB图像进行基于重建的模型预训练，并设计目标聚焦的预训练损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过引入姿态感知信息，有效提升了复杂场景下的姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的特征，但这些特征过于粗粒度，不符合检测任务需求。

Method: 结合ABG（生成细粒度实例级交互特征）和LSG（提供细粒度监督），形成双边协作框架。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异，开放和封闭设置均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BC-HOI通过双边协作有效解决了开放词汇HOI检测中的细粒度特征问题。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Conclusion: FIFA和后校正工具为VideoMLLMs的忠实性评估和生成内容改进提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念遗忘方法难以平衡遗忘效果与生成能力，存在安全风险。

Method: 提出KSCU方法，专注于影响最终生成的关键步骤，仅在这些步骤微调模型。

Result: 实验表明KSCU能有效防止生成不良图像，同时保留生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU为T2I扩散模型的安全使用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种完整的流水线系统，将英语语音转换为流畅的3D手语动画，填补了从语音到手语动画的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助聋人和听力障碍者更轻松地交流，解决从语音到手语动画转换这一被忽视的研究方向。

Method: 使用Whisper将语音转为文本，MarianMT模型将文本翻译为ASL gloss，结合Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，并通过3D关键点运动系统生成动画。

Result: 系统表现优异，BLEU分数达0.7714和0.8923，并创建了Sign3D-WLASL和BookGlossCorpus-CG两个新数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究整合了音频、文本和动作数据，实现了从语音到逼真3D手语动画的完整转换，超越了以往单一数据类型的局限性。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏显式的时空交互协调，难以适应不同未来环境。受人类驾驶行为启发，提出动态调整初始决策的模型。

Method: 采用逆向学习注意力建模交互，动态锚点选择模块提取关键点作为锚点。

Result: 在INTERACTION和Argoverse数据集上表现最优，尤其在复杂交互场景中精度更高。

Conclusion: ILNet通过动态建模交互和锚点选择，显著提升了轨迹预测的性能。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Motivation: 野生动物相机陷阱数据量大，标注和模型训练成本高，现有主动学习方法需要完全访问模型，限制了应用。

Method: 结合对象和图像层面的不确定性与多样性指标，进行主动学习样本选择。

Result: 仅使用30%的训练数据，即可达到或超过完整数据集的检测性能。

Conclusion: 模型无关的主动学习方法能显著减少数据标注需求，提升野生动物监测效率。

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Motivation: 动态场景的紧凑和时间感知表示对视觉跟踪和机器人操作等任务至关重要。

Method: ToBo通过压缩步骤将参考场景编码为瓶颈标记，在扩展步骤中利用少量目标补丁预测目标场景。

Result: ToBo在视频标签传播和机器人操作等任务中优于基线方法，并在真实环境中验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ToBo能有效学习动态场景的时序依赖，且在不同模型规模下具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现优异，但其广泛使用引发了版权和透明度问题。现有方法无法识别特定元素（如风格或对象）的贡献，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了Concept-TRAK方法，扩展了影响函数，包括基于扩散后验采样的训练损失重构和强调语义相关性的概念感知奖励函数。

Result: 在AbC基准测试中，Concept-TRAK显著优于现有方法，并通过案例研究展示了其在版权保护、内容安全和生成AI治理中的实用性。

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK通过概念级归因分析，为生成AI的负责任开发和治理提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

Motivation: 现有方法主要捕捉成对关系，未能建模多视图的联合结构。

Method: 提出DSF，将多视图表示为分布并计算分布间的散度作为相似性度量。

Result: DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF有效捕捉多视图联合结构，无需温度超参数，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数EBT，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，分别赋予监督权重，显著提升了边缘检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失函数对所有非边缘像素一视同仁，忽略了边界附近的结构差异，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失函数，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并为每类分配不同的监督权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EBT损失函数在定量和感知上均优于WBCE，且超参数鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: EBT损失函数易于部署，性能优越，是边缘检测任务的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

Motivation: 现有方法因粗粒度匹配和忽略语义线索而难以处理运动冗余问题。

Method: 提出时间片段Banzhaf交互，量化文本-运动片段一致性，并利用检索的运动片段生成语义一致的运动。

Result: MOST在文本到运动检索和生成任务中达到最先进性能，尤其在罕见提示上表现突出。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度片段关系解决了运动冗余问题，显著提升了生成效果。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Conclusion: 自适应边缘对比学习方法能有效处理模糊点，显著提升3D语义分割效果。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

Motivation: HDR视频重建中，交替曝光方法导致的曝光波动常引起闪烁问题，需要更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 使用双摄像头系统（DCS）分别捕获参考和非参考序列，并设计EAFNet网络，包含预对齐子网络、非对称跨特征融合子网络和基于DWT的多尺度重建子网络。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集上达到了最先进的性能，验证了DCS在HDR视频重建中的潜力。

Conclusion: DCS和EAFNet的结合有效解决了HDR视频的闪烁问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

Motivation: 长时动作识别（LTAR）因时间跨度长、动作关联复杂及视觉混淆问题而具有挑战性。现有方法多依赖统计相关性而非因果机制，且缺乏跨模态因果建模。

Result: 在Charades、Breakfast和COIN三个基准测试中，CMDCL表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过双因果干预显著提升了长时动作识别的性能，为跨模态因果建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

Motivation: 医学高光谱成像（MHSI）在疾病诊断中潜力巨大，但高维度和光谱冗余特性使其空间和光谱信息融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了跨维度特征融合操作，包括双向注意力机制、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段跨维度解码器。

Result: 在两个显微高光谱图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在DSC指标上比现有方法提升了5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse通过高效的跨维度特征融合，显著提升了高光谱图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低且资源高效。

Conclusion: PointVDP提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案，提升了点云分割的语义理解能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

Motivation: 自监督学习（SSL）在数字病理学中可能忽略复杂的领域特定特征，且数据效率低，需要大量计算资源。

Method: 提出EXAONE Path 2.0模型，通过直接幻灯片级监督学习补丁级表示，仅使用37k WSIs进行训练。

Result: 在10项生物标志物预测任务中达到最先进性能，表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0通过直接监督学习显著提升了病理学任务的性能和数据效率。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Conclusion: ClipGS在渲染质量和效率上均优于现有技术，适用于医学数据的交互式可视化。

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P提出了一种基于扩散模型的图像到点云（I2P）配准框架，通过控制侧分数蒸馏（CSD）和可变形对应调整（DCT）模块，显著提升了跨模态配准性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通过度量学习实现跨模态特征对齐，但忽略了图像与点云之间的模态差异，导致配准效果不佳。

Method: 提出Diff$^2$I2P框架，利用扩散模型作为先验，结合CSD和DCT模块，实现可微的对应关系估计和配准。

Result: 在7-Scenes基准测试中，Diff$^2$I2P比现有方法提升了7%以上的配准召回率。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P通过扩散模型和可微设计，显著提升了跨模态配准的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Conclusion: CDR-CA任务及Multi-Source DPPs方法能灵活优化多样性，适应不同应用需求。

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: SPGD通过有效的梯度管理，解决了扩散模型中的不稳定问题，为图像恢复任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Conclusion: MK-Pose无需形状先验即可实现高性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法需要大量重新训练或微调，缺乏灵活性，无法适应不同压缩需求。

Method: 采用混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝技术，无需重新训练。

Result: 压缩率高达96.4%，渲染质量损失小（PSNR下降<1 dB），速度比现有方法快1.7-2.1倍。

Conclusion: FlexGaussian是一种灵活、高效的3D高斯压缩方法，适用于移动设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being

Conclusion: QUANet通过创新的数量感知设计和双流解码器，显著提升了文本提示对象计数的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Abstract: We propose a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for the

music-to-skeleton translation and skeleton-to-video translation. In the
music-to-skeleton translation, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal graph
Mamba (STGM) block to effectively construct skeleton sequences from the input
music, capturing dependencies between joints in both the spatial and temporal
dimensions. For the skeleton-to-video translation, we propose a novel
self-supervised regularization network to translate the generated skeletons,
along with a conditional image, into a dance video. Lastly, we collect a new

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner通过结合LLM驱动的空间推理和视觉属性增强的分层特征场，显著提升了开放词汇3D视觉定位的性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉与文本表示之间存在差距，伪注释和对比对齐策略能有效解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层特征提取（帧、片段、视频级）并与伪注释和口语对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了BLEU-4和ROUGE分数，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: 分层预训练策略显著提升了手语翻译的性能。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像融合需整合多模态信息以提升视觉任务性能，但全局空间建模计算成本高且缺乏真实数据。

Method: RPFNet采用双分支框架：残差先验模块提取模态差异信息，频域融合模块实现高效全局建模，交叉促进模块增强局部与全局特征协同。

Result: 实验表明RPFNet能有效整合特征、增强纹理细节和显著目标，提升高级视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: RPFNet通过频域和残差先验驱动，解决了图像融合中的关键挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了SOTA模型，还为工业AI领域贡献了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

Motivation: 固定频率的缓存机制在复杂场景中会导致质量下降，手动调整阈值效率低且不鲁棒。

Method: 提出PCA缓存，根据输入提示估计场景复杂度动态调整重用阈值；改进TeaCache的输入输出建模；引入动态CFGCache机制。

Result: 实验表明，方法在Wan2.1模型上实现了2.79倍加速，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: PCA缓存和动态CFGCache机制有效解决了推理速度瓶颈，提升了视频生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种局部和全局双粒度身份关联机制，通过跨模态关系强化和动态调整，显著提升了文本到人物图像匹配的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂的一对多身份关系，限制了性能提升。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了跨模态匹配准确性。

Conclusion: 为文本到人物图像匹配提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Motivation: 满语作为濒危语言对研究早期现代东亚历史至关重要，但缺乏有效的OCR系统处理真实历史文档。

Method: 研究微调了三个开源视觉语言模型（LLaMA-3.2-11B、Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Qwen2.5-VL-3B），使用6万张合成满语单词图像进行参数高效训练。

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing

Motivation: 多模态推理研究中模态对齐和训练成本问题尚未充分解决，现有方法依赖额外标注和规则奖励，增加了成本和限制了扩展性。

Method: 提出D2I框架，训练时通过规则奖励设置深思熟虑的推理策略，评估时转为直觉推理，隐式反映模型能力。

Result: D2I在领域内外基准测试中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: D2I展示了规则奖励在多模态推理中的潜力，为训练与测试推理深度解耦提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式医疗图像分析提供了更可靠和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集为语音-手势视频生成研究提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Motivation: 现有基于sRGB和HSV颜色空间的低光图像增强方法存在颜色偏差和噪声问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+网络，结合预训练的视觉语言模型和先验引导注意力块（PAB），通过区域细化块优化亮度调整。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上，HVI-CIDNet+优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+有效解决了低光图像增强中的颜色失真和噪声问题，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Result: 在经典力学场景中成功恢复真实运动方程，生成的视频物理对齐优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架无需微调现有模型即可提升视频生成的物理准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自注意力图的可解释性，减少了细粒度标注数据的需求，为弱监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

Result: IAP在多种基准测试中实现高攻击成功率，同时显著提升补丁的不可见性，并能绕过现有防御系统。

Conclusion: IAP在对抗性补丁攻击中实现了隐蔽性和有效性的平衡，为未来防御研究提供了挑战。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

Conclusion: SemRaFiner通过优化特征提取和训练流程，显著提升了雷达点云的全景分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Conclusion: APL方法通过自适应部分学习，有效解决了GCD任务中的判别性与泛化性权衡问题。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 通过深度学习模型和聚类算法分析卫星图像中的棕榈树分布，揭示古代人类对植被的长期管理影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究古代人类对热带森林的长期管理效应，尤其是高分辨率尺度下的影响。

Method: 结合深度学习模型（识别棕榈树）和聚类算法（识别棕榈树集群），利用高分辨率卫星图像数据（765平方公里）分析棕榈分布与考古遗址的关系。

Result: 棕榈树在考古遗址附近显著更多，且人类管理区域可能比考古证据显示的大两个数量级。

Conclusion: 古代人类通过管理植被促进棕榈树生长，留下持久生态足迹，为基础设施选址提供便利。AI与生态考古数据结合可揭示精细尺度的人地互动。

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

TL;DR: CheXPO通过结合置信度-相似性联合挖掘和反事实推理，优化医学视觉语言模型的偏好，减少幻觉问题，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型（VLMs）易产生幻觉，影响可靠性，而传统偏好优化方法面临数据分布不均、专家标注成本高等问题。

Method: 提出CheXPO策略，包括多任务胸部X光视觉指令数据集合成、基于置信度的硬样本识别、相似性检索扩展样本，以及反事实推理提供临床偏好。

Result: 实验表明，CheXPO仅用5%的SFT样本即实现8.93%的相对性能提升，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

Motivation: 精确的可变形图像配准（DIR）在MR引导自适应放疗（MRgART）中对轮廓传播和剂量累积至关重要。本研究旨在开发一种适用于多域MR-MR配准的深度学习方法。

Method: 采用逐步优化的配准与分割（ProRSeg）方法，使用加权分割一致性损失训练，并在同域、跨域和混合域数据集上测试性能。

Result: ProRSeg在膀胱配准中表现稳定（DSC 0.88-0.86），直肠和CTV性能依赖域，跨域MRL数据集表现更优（DSC 0.89）。剂量累积结果显示83.3%患者满足CTV覆盖和膀胱保护约束。

Conclusion: ProRSeg在多域MR-MR配准中表现合理，初步验证了其在评估临床约束治疗合规性中的可行性。

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

TL;DR: Percep360是一种用于自动驾驶的全景生成方法，通过局部场景扩散方法和概率提示方法实现高质量、可控的全景数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要全景感知，但数据采集复杂且耗时。现有方法无法实现高质量、可控的全景生成。

Method: 提出局部场景扩散方法（LSDM）和概率提示方法（PPM），分别解决信息丢失和可控生成问题。

Result: 生成图像在质量评估、可控性和下游任务（如BEV分割）中表现优于原始拼接图像。

Conclusion: Percep360为自动驾驶提供了高效、可控的全景数据生成方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

Method: 创建MassID45数据集，结合分子和成像数据，利用AI辅助工具进行分割和分类标注。

Result: 标注了超过17000个标本，为批量昆虫样本的分类提供了高精度数据。

Conclusion: MassID45数据集为昆虫群落的快速大规模表征提供了潜力，推动了小物体检测和实例分割的创新。

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

Motivation: 解决传统测试时适应方法依赖昂贵训练或优化过程，以及对历史数据访问假设的问题。

Method: 提出FreeTTA，利用在线EM算法建模测试数据分布，通过零样本预测迭代更新参数。

Result: 在15个数据集上，FreeTTA在跨域和分布外场景中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeTTA为测试时适应提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，首次明确建模测试数据分布，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的感知系统在恶劣天气下易受传感器性能下降的影响，集体感知虽有潜力但尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出DenoiseCP-Net，集成体素级去噪和物体检测，采用稀疏卷积骨干网络减少冗余计算。

Result: 在模拟恶劣天气的OPV2V数据集上，DenoiseCP-Net实现了高去噪精度，带宽需求降低23.6%，同时保持检测精度和低延迟。

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在放射学报告生成中难以准确映射病理和解剖特征到文本描述，且特征提取缺乏语义理解。

Method: MCA-RG利用病理库和解剖库对齐视觉特征，采用对比学习和匹配损失优化特征，并通过特征门控机制过滤低质量特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

Motivation: 精准预测NSCLC患者免疫治疗的预后对个性化治疗至关重要，但缺乏大规模数据集和有效的多模态融合方法。

Method: 提出跨模态掩码学习框架，包括Slice-Depth Transformer处理3D CT图像和基于图的Transformer处理临床数据，通过掩码策略促进模态间特征融合。

Result: 该方法在多模态融合中表现优异，超越了现有方法，为NSCLC预后模型设立了新基准。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了NSCLC生存预测的准确性，为个性化治疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Conclusion: GNN-ViTCap提供高效可靠的病理诊断解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，为从H&E图像预测细胞组成提供了一种低成本替代方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过整合上下文元数据（如GPS位置、时间戳和食物项）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在营养分析中的表现，并提出了新的公开数据集ACETADA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），而忽略了其他LMMs的潜力，且上下文元数据与推理修饰符的交互影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过整合GPS坐标、时间戳和食物项等元数据，结合多种推理修饰符（如Chain-of-Thought），评估八种LMMs的性能。

Result: 实验表明，智能整合元数据能显著降低营养值预测的平均绝对误差（MAE）和平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有显著潜力，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

*Yulin An,Enrique del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何深度学习的框架，用于高效预测CAD网格的Laplace-Beltrami（LB）谱，显著节省计算时间且保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算LB谱复杂度高，不适用于大规模CAD机械零件数据库或快速质量检测场景。

Method: 采用图神经网络架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率等丰富网格特征，预测LB谱。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比线性FEM快约5倍，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 证明了LB谱的可学习性，为几何深度学习在CAD领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: RulerNet是一个深度学习框架，通过将标尺读数统一为关键点检测问题，实现像素到真实世界尺寸的准确转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中像素测量到真实尺寸转换的挑战，支持生物医学、法医学等关键应用。

Method: 采用几何级数参数表示标尺，结合合成数据训练策略，提出轻量级网络DeepGP实现实时估计。

Result: RulerNet在多样化条件下提供准确、一致的尺寸估计，适用于移动或边缘设备。

Conclusion: RulerNet是一个通用测量工具，可与其他视觉组件集成，支持自动化、规模感知分析。

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动评估指标L-VQAScore，用于解决文本到图像生成模型中实体-属性关联的评估问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型的评估方法在复杂组合生成（如时尚领域）中存在局限性，尤其是实体-属性语义的评估不足。

Method: 基于视觉问答（VQA）定位策略，提出L-VQAScore，结合视觉定位和VQA探测正确与错误属性生成。

Result: 在新数据集上，L-VQAScore在与人评估相关性上优于现有方法，能捕捉细粒度实体-属性关联。

Conclusion: L-VQAScore可作为主观评估的可靠且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出VLV框架，利用预训练组件构建高效视觉语言模型，显著降低数据需求和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型需要大量高质量图像-文本对和GPU资源，成本高昂。

Method: 结合预训练视觉编码器、T2I扩散模型解码器和LLM，通过信息瓶颈和知识蒸馏优化语言表示。

Result: 构建了与GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的先进字幕生成器，成本低于1000美元。

Conclusion: VLV框架高效且经济，为视觉语言任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at

core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,
fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and
X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

Result: 扩散模型在视觉理解任务中表现优异，尤其在需要空间和组合推理的任务中。

Conclusion: 扩散模型作为视觉编码器具有潜力，特别是在需要细粒度理解的视觉任务中。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found
