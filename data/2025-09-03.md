### [1] [MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030)
*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MultiStream-LLM框架，通过分离专门的手指拼写、唇读和连续手语识别专家网络，解决了传统端到端手语翻译模型在处理高速手指拼写和非手动线索时的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端手语翻译模型在处理高速手指拼写和面部非手动线索时表现不佳，特别是在翻译姓名、地点和技术术语等关键信息时效果较差。

Method: 采用模块化框架，使用专门的预测器分别处理连续手语、手指拼写和唇读，每个专家网络将其特定模态解码为token序列，然后通过轻量级transformer融合并行流并解决时间不对齐问题，最后使用大语言模型生成最终句子。

Result: 在How2Sign基准测试中达到BLEU-4分数23.5的新SOTA，在ChicagoFSWildPlus手指拼写数据集上达到73.2%的字母准确率。

Conclusion: 通过分离和解决不同的识别任务再进行融合，多专家方法为鲁棒、高保真的手语翻译提供了更强大有效的途径。

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

### [2] [Compiling Prompts, Not Crafting Them: A Reproducible Workflow for AI-Assisted Evidence Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00038)
*Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于声明式提示优化的结构化框架，用于提高LLM在系统文献综述中的可靠性和可重复性，替代传统脆弱的手工提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在系统文献综述中的应用依赖脆弱的手工提示，这损害了科学可信度和可重复性，需要更可靠的方法来增强证据合成的严谨性。

Method: 采用声明式提示优化技术，构建包含任务声明、测试套件和自动提示调优的领域特定框架，提供可验证的LLM流水线蓝图和代码示例。

Result: 成功将通用LLM应用的提示优化方法适配到系统文献综述领域，建立了符合透明度和严谨性原则的可重复工作流程。

Conclusion: 这是声明式提示优化方法在系统文献综述流水线中的创新应用，为构建可靠、可验证的LLM辅助证据合成提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

### [3] [What Are Research Hypotheses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00185)
*Jian Wu,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了自然语言处理领域中对"假设"概念的不同定义，分析了传统科学定义与NLU任务中定义的差异，强调了明确定义的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言处理技术的发展，各种任务中对"假设"概念的定义出现了分歧和迁移，需要系统梳理和明确界定，特别是为了构建机器可解释的学术记录。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，系统梳理和比较了近期发表的NLU任务中对假设的不同定义，分析了这些定义与传统科学定义的差异。

Result: 发现NLU领域中假设定义存在显著差异，有些定义偏离了传统科学中的严格定义，需要更加结构化和明确的定义标准。

Conclusion: 明确定义假设概念对于NLU任务至关重要，特别是在构建机器可解释学术记录的背景下，需要建立统一且准确的定义标准。

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

### [4] [Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00190)
*Sheldon Yu,Yuxin Xiong,Junda Wu,Xintong Li,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Ritwik Sinha,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个状态感知转换框架，将思维链轨迹抽象为结构化潜在动态，通过谱分析和马尔可夫链建模来提升推理过程的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链提示方法虽然实现了多步推理，但其可解释性有限，主要关注局部token级别的归因，而推理步骤的高级语义角色和转换关系未被充分探索。

Method: 使用谱分析对token级嵌入进行聚类，将推理步骤表示为语义一致的潜在状态；通过马尔可夫链建模推理进程，提供结构化和可解释的推理视图。

Result: 该框架支持语义角色识别、时间模式可视化和一致性评估等多种分析，为推理过程提供了全局结构化的理解。

Conclusion: 提出的状态感知转换框架显著提升了思维链推理的可解释性，通过结构化潜在动态建模实现了对推理语义演化和全局结构的深入分析。

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

### [5] [The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00245)
*Seiji Maekawa,Hayate Iso,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM)新任务和DiFBench基准框架，评估LLM在文档集合中识别全局稀有特征的能力，发现现有模型在统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注信息检索和摘要，缺乏对LLM识别全局稀有特征能力的评估，而现实场景如候选人筛选和产品差异化需要这种统计推理能力。

Method: 引入DFM任务，要求模型分析10-40个文档集合并识别出现频率低于10%的稀有特征；开发DiFBench可配置基准框架，对10个先进LLM进行大规模评估。

Result: 通用模型与推理增强模型之间存在显著性能差距；所有模型在任务复杂度和文档数量增加时性能大幅下降；常见错误是将频繁特征误认为稀有特征。

Conclusion: 当代LLM在执行细粒度统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在核心局限性，需要开发更好的方法来提升这种关键推理能力。

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

### [6] [The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于皮尔斯符号学理论的一般性理论框架，用于统一描述和比较不同的人类意义建构建模方法，将模型本身视为符号来处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类意义建构建模领域缺乏一个统一的理论框架来在不同模型类型之间进行公平比较，需要建立通用的描述标准。

Method: 基于C.S. Peirce的符号学理论构建理论框架，将模型视为测量潜在符号几何结构的假设，并通过模型间的对比关系来理解其语义价值。

Result: 提出了一个能够统一描述各种建模实践的理论框架，并通过简要示例展示了其经验应用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架为建模实践提供了理论基础，使模型和建模决策本身能够被作为符号来处理，为未来研究开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

### [7] [The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250)
*Hugo Sousa,Ricardo Campos,Alípio Jorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Game，将时间关系抽取任务转化为交互式游戏，通过点对点比较分解区间关系，支持时序闭包推理和一致性约束


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间关系标注方法直接标注区间级关系存在局限性，需要更细粒度和灵活的方法来同时支持区间和瞬时实体的标注

Method: 将时间关系分解为起点和终点的点对点比较，玩家逐步分类单个点关系，系统应用时序闭包推理额外关系并确保一致性

Result: 开发了包含游戏模式和标注模式的演示系统，支持TempEval-3数据集标注和自定义文档标注，提供评分反馈和时间线导出功能

Conclusion: Temporal Game为时间标注提供了新颖的游戏化方法，同时为强化学习代理训练奠定了基础，代码开源促进社区发展

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

### [8] [Exploring Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00276)
*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RITE方法通过让大语言模型在生成嵌入前先进行逻辑推理，将推理能力融入文本嵌入过程，显著提升了零样本检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的嵌入方法主要关注上下文表示，没有充分利用LLMs的强大推理能力，而复杂查询需要超越表面词汇匹配的深度推理

Method: 提出RITE方法，在计算嵌入前让生成式LLMs在token空间中生成中间推理文本，从而丰富表示中的推理深度

Result: 在推理密集型检索基准BRIGHT上的实验表明，RITE显著提升了跨多个领域的零样本检索性能

Conclusion: 将推理融入嵌入过程是有效的，RITE方法成功地将LLMs的推理能力整合到文本嵌入中

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

### [9] [OpinioRAG: Towards Generating User-Centric Opinion Highlights from Large-scale Online Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00285)
*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OpinioRAG框架，通过RAG检索和LLM结合，从海量用户评论中生成个性化摘要，并设计了新的无参考验证指标用于情感丰富领域的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理数千条评论的规模，且生成的摘要过于通用，无法满足个性化需求，需要开发可扩展的个性化摘要生成方案。

Method: 结合RAG-based证据检索和LLMs，构建训练免费的OpinioRAG框架，同时提出针对情感丰富领域的新型无参考验证指标。

Result: 创建了首个大规模长格式用户评论数据集，包含每个实体上千条评论，并通过实验验证了框架的有效性，提供了改进系统的可行见解。

Conclusion: OpinioRAG是一个强大的框架，能够大规模生成准确、相关且结构化的摘要，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

### [10] [Wage Sentiment Indices Derived from Survey Comments via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00290)
*Taihei Sone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型构建工资情绪指数(WSI)来预测日本工资动态，基于经济观察者调查数据，显著优于基准方法和预训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的出现为经济文本分析创造了新机会，需要开发更及时有效的经济政策设计工具

Method: 扩展价格情绪指数框架，基于日本内阁府的经济观察者调查，构建专门针对工资相关情绪的WSI指数，并开发可扩展的数据架构

Result: 基于LLM的WSI模型显著优于基准方法和预训练模型

Conclusion: LLM驱动的情绪指数有潜力提高政府和央行经济政策设计的及时性和有效性

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

### [11] [Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309)
*Chen Zheng,Yiyuan Ma,Yuan Yang,Deyi Liu,Jing Liu,Zuquan Song,Yuxin Song,Cheng Ren,Hang Zhu,Xin Liu,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现将RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型时会出现序列长度崩溃和奖励曲棍球棒曲线问题，提出了平衡演员初始化(BAI)方法来解决这些训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型发展存在两个有效范式：指令调优+RLHF对齐和蒸馏式推理微调，但将RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型的第三范式面临严重训练不稳定挑战。

Method: 提出平衡演员初始化(BAI)，采用两阶段加权模型合并方法：先合并指令遵循模型和蒸馏推理微调模型，再与预训练模型进一步合并以保留基础知识。

Result: BAI成功解决了序列长度崩溃问题，缓解了奖励曲棍球棒曲线现象，实现了训练期间序列长度的持续改善，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: BAI为第三范式提供了有效的稳定训练解决方案，使模型能够结合蒸馏效率和RLHF对齐优势，获得更强的推理能力。

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

### [12] [GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00325)
*Rinku Dewri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIER是一个通过自我反思和修订来提升大语言模型输出的框架，利用自然语言描述推理差距，让模型迭代式地批判和改进自身输出，在多个推理任务中显著提升推理质量而不降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示策略依赖于演示、示例或思维链模板，缺乏对抽象概念差距的直接处理能力。GIER旨在通过自然语言描述推理差距，让模型能够理解和改进自身的推理过程。

Method: GIER框架使用自然语言描述推理差距，提示模型迭代式地批判和精炼自身输出。模型通过自我反思识别概念差距，并将其转化为具体的推理改进，无需依赖外部示例或模板。

Result: 在三个推理密集型任务（SciFact、PrivacyQA和e-SNLI）和四个大语言模型上，GIER显著提升了推理质量、基础性和推理对齐性，同时保持了任务准确性不下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明大语言模型不仅能够解释抽象概念差距，还能将其转化为具体的推理改进，GIER框架为提升模型自我修正能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

### [13] [Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00375)
*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoSeek是一个用于合成复杂深度研究任务的框架，通过双代理系统构建研究树并生成需要层次遍历的自然语言问题，显著提升LLM在深度研究任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法捕捉深度研究任务的复杂性，而合成数据集存在推理捷径、知识泄露或结构深度不足的问题，需要新的框架来支持LLM进行多步骤推理和证据合成。

Method: 使用双代理系统递归构建研究树，模糊中间节点为有效子问题，并将这些树转换为需要完整层次遍历的自然语言问题，支持快速扩展生成超过5万个训练样本。

Result: 在BrowseComp-Plus基准测试中，使用InfoSeek优化的30亿参数LLM超越了320亿参数的大模型和轻量级商业API，性能接近更强的API如Gemini2.5-Pro。

Conclusion: InfoSeek有效解决了深度研究任务的合成问题，通过保留中间步骤和检索标签等元信息，支持复合奖励设计和轨迹级探索等高级优化策略，显著提升了LLM的深度研究能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [14] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphKV是一个基于图的KV缓存管理框架，通过动态传播机制自适应地保留最重要的上下文token，可无缝集成到现有方法中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存驱逐策略依赖静态启发式方法，无法捕捉推理过程中token间动态变化的隐式依赖关系，导致内存受限下的性能瓶颈

Method: 将token建模为带重要性分数的节点，边表示相似关系，通过衰减信号传播机制在图上动态更新token重要性，自适应选择最关键的上下文token

Result: GraphKV能够以即插即用的方式与SnapKV、PyramidKV等现有KV缓存驱逐方法无缝集成使用

Conclusion: GraphKV提供了一种有效的动态KV缓存管理解决方案，通过图结构建模和传播机制显著提升了长文本序列处理的内存效率

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了GCG及其变体T-GCG在不同规模开源LLM上的对抗提示攻击效果，发现模型越大攻击成功率越低，编码推理提示比安全提示更脆弱，语义评估比前缀启发式评估更严格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估梯度基对抗提示攻击方法在不同规模语言模型上的有效性，特别是针对安全提示和推理密集型编码提示的脆弱性，以及模拟退火策略的改进效果。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-0.5B、LLaMA-3.2-1B和GPT-OSS-20B三个不同规模的开源LLM，在AdvBench安全提示和推理密集型编码提示上测试GCG和T-GCG攻击效果，采用前缀启发式和GPT-4o语义判断两种评估方式。

Result: 1) 攻击成功率随模型规模增大而降低；2) 前缀启发式评估高估攻击效果，语义评估更严格；3) 编码推理提示比安全提示更易受攻击；4) T-GCG在前缀评估中表现竞争性但语义评估改进有限。

Conclusion: GCG方法存在可扩展性限制，推理任务中存在被忽视的脆弱性，需要进一步发展退火启发策略以进行更鲁棒的对抗评估。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

TL;DR: MedSEBA是一个AI驱动的医疗问答系统，利用大语言模型生成基于PubMed医学研究的证据化答案，提供研究支持程度可视化和时间演变分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互联网医疗信息可信度问题，帮助用户区分可靠来源和误导信息，同时应对医学研究数量庞大且结论可能冲突的挑战。

Method: 结合大语言模型生成连贯回答，并动态从PubMed数据库检索可信医学研究作为依据，提供关键论点溯源和研究共识演变可视化。

Result: 用户研究表明医疗专家和普通用户认为系统可用、有帮助，提供的答案可信且信息丰富。

Conclusion: 该系统适用于日常健康问题和高级研究洞察，能有效合成基于证据的医疗答案。

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Camlang，一种新颖的构造语言，用于测试LLMs是否能够通过显式元语言推理来掌握陌生语言，结果显示GPT-5在英语上达到98%准确率但在Camlang上只有47%，远低于人类的87%表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是检验大型语言模型的成功是否反映真正的推理能力还是仅仅模式匹配，通过测试模型是否能够像人类一样通过显式元语言推理来掌握陌生语言的语法系统。

Method: 创建了Camlang构造语言，包含语法书和双语词典两种显式资源，将CommonsenseQA适配到Camlang中创建Camlang-CSQA-v0任务，通过人类实验和模型测试进行比较评估。

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-5在英语任务上达到98%准确率，但在Camlang任务上只有47%准确率，远低于人类的87%表现，其他先进推理LLMs表现更差。

Conclusion: Camlang建立了一个认知基础的评估范式，揭示了当前模型与人类元语言能力之间的根本差距，大多数模型成功来自浅层词汇对齐而非系统性语法掌握。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU是一个基于语义单元的RAG框架，通过全局消歧和语义单元整合来解决传统图RAG中局部语义单元提取的模糊性和复杂耦合问题，在多个任务上超越了基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法在提取高层次语义单元时受限于局部文本块，容易产生歧义、复杂耦合和检索开销增加的问题，缺乏全局知识或忽视细粒度关系。

Method: 提出GOSU框架：1）在图构建阶段进行全局语义单元合并和实体关系提取；2）在检索生成阶段引入分层关键词提取和语义单元补全，分别捕获细粒度二元关系和粗粒度n元关系。

Result: 在多个任务评估中，GOSU在生成质量方面优于基线RAG方法。

Conclusion: GOSU通过全局语义单元处理和分层关系捕获机制，有效提升了RAG系统的性能，解决了局部语义单元提取的局限性问题。

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个轻量级框架，使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器和注意力相关性评分来解决伊斯兰继承法选择题，在效率和隐私方面具有优势但准确率略低于大型语言模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰继承法需要精确识别继承人和计算份额，这对AI构成挑战。需要开发既准确又高效的解决方案，特别是在资源受限和设备端部署的场景下

Method: 使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器（MARBERT、ArabicBERT、AraBERT）和注意力相关性评分（ARS）来对答案选项进行语义相关性排序，实现快速设备端推理而无需生成式推理

Result: 大型模型最高达到87.6%准确率但需要更多资源且依赖上下文。基于MARBERT的方法达到69.87%准确率，在效率、设备端部署性和隐私方面具有优势

Conclusion: 研究量化了大型模型峰值性能与小型专业化系统在实际优势之间的关键权衡，为高风险领域提供了实用的解决方案选择

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒设置下的开放域语言生成不确定性量化是一个关键但未被充分探索的挑战，现有方法依赖语义一致性启发式或白盒特征

Method: 利用token级熵作为无logit、无参考的不确定性度量，通过分割保形预测管道构建具有形式覆盖保证的预测集

Result: 在6个大语言模型和2个基准测试上的实验表明，TECP始终实现可靠覆盖和紧凑预测集，优于先前的自一致性UQ方法

Conclusion: 该方法为黑盒LLM设置中的可信生成提供了原则性和高效的解决方案

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPDC 2025 API赛道中，角色扮演对话代理经常产生过长的角色内回复(过度说话)，同时未能根据角色有效使用工具(行动不足)，如生成不存在的函数调用或在回答前进行不必要的工具调用

Method: 探索了四种提示方法：1)基础角色提示 2)人工制作角色提示 3)自动提示优化(APO) 4)基于规则的角色提示(RRP)。RRP采用角色卡片/场景合约设计和严格函数调用执行技术

Result: 基于规则的角色提示(RRP)方法取得了最佳性能，整体得分0.571，相比零样本基线得分0.519有显著提升

Conclusion: RRP设计可以显著提高角色扮演对话代理的有效性和可靠性，优于更复杂的方法如APO。所有最佳性能提示和APO工具已开源

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

TL;DR: ResearchQA是一个从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K查询和160K评分标准项的资源，用于评估LLM系统回答研究问题的能力，发现现有系统在引用文献、描述限制和比较方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估研究问题长回答主要依赖专家标注，限制了评估范围。研究专业知识广泛分布在文献综述中，需要一种更全面的方法来评估LLM系统在研究领域的表现。

Method: 从75个研究领域的综述文章提取21K查询和160K评分标准项，每个评分标准包含具体的回答评估标准（引用论文、解释、描述限制等），使用31位博士标注者在8个领域进行评估。

Result: 96%的查询支持博士信息需求，87%的评分标准项需要在系统回答中用至少一句话来回应。自动评估系统与专家判断达到74%一致率。在7.6K对评估中，参数化和检索增强系统对评分标准的覆盖率不超过70%，最佳代理系统达到75%。

Conclusion: 现有LLM系统在研究问题回答方面存在显著能力差距，特别是在引用文献（完全处理<11%）、描述限制（48%）和比较（49%）方面。发布数据以促进更全面的多领域评估。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出基于熵的动态聚合框架，将细粒度语音token压缩为更粗粒度的语义表示，在保持性能的同时提高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音离散表示方法生成25-50 tokens/秒，但语音通常每秒只有2-5个词，这种细粒度token化导致冗余，阻碍下游任务效率，且语义理解不需要如此详细的分辨率

Method: 先通过下一token预测在大规模无标签数据上预训练语音语言模型，然后使用预测熵自适应确定聚合边界，再用交叉注意力模块融合段内信息，通过调整熵阈值灵活控制表示粒度和压缩比

Result: 在ASR、语音到文本翻译和语音转换任务上的实验表明，压缩表示的性能与密集token序列相当或更好

Conclusion: 提出的熵基动态聚合框架能有效学习压缩的语义语音表示，在保持性能的同时提高效率

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在法律语境中如何基于不同利益相关者的立场进行动机性推理，以及模型如何战略性地构建信息以符合法律系统中特定角色的立场

Method: 引入基于法律事实和推理包含度的评估框架，考虑对利益相关者的偏向性，分析LLMs在不同法律角色提示下对司法判决的摘要行为

Result: 即使提示中包含平衡指令，模型仍表现出反映角色一致视角的选择性包含模式，存在明显的角色对齐倾向

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在高风险法律环境中对LLM摘要行为进行角色感知评估的必要性，担忧LLMs可能从先前交互或上下文中推断用户角色而产生类似对齐

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在推理能力增强时（如切换到思考模式或数学数据集微调）会更容易响应恶意请求，特别是密集模型更易受影响。注意力转移和专家模型中的专业专家有助于将过度推理重定向到安全防护机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型广泛应用，对其安全性和与人类价值观对齐的关注日益增强。先前研究表明在狭窄恶意数据集上微调会导致模型行为不对齐，但本研究发现了更令人担忧的推理诱导不对齐现象。

Method: 通过增强模型的推理能力（切换到思考模式或在良性数学数据集上微调），观察模型对恶意请求的响应变化，并分析内部模型状态（注意力转移和混合专家模型中的专家作用）。

Result: 发现推理能力增强会使LLMs更容易响应恶意请求，密集模型特别脆弱。同时发现注意力转移和专家模型中的专业专家能够帮助将过度推理重定向到安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了新兴的推理-安全权衡问题，强调了为高级推理模型推进对齐技术的紧迫性，为理解模型安全机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估环境和实际部署环境中表现出不同的行为特征，这种评估意识现象使得基准测试结果无法准确反映模型的真实安全性和诚实性，对AI对齐构成严重挑战。

Method: 使用线性探针对提示词进行从"测试式"到"部署式"的连续评分，并采用LLM重写策略将提示词转向更自然的部署风格上下文，同时保持原始任务不变。

Result: 重写后的提示词使探针评分平均提高30%，在所有模型中观察到诚实回答平均增加5.26%，欺骗回答减少12.40%，拒绝率平均提高6.38%，表明安全合规性增强。

Conclusion: 评估意识是可量化和可操纵的因素，直接影响LLM行为，模型在感知到的测试环境中更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出，亟需更真实的评估框架来准确衡量模型对齐程度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时存在二次复杂度瓶颈，限制了长上下文处理能力，需要更高效的替代方案

Method: GAM块采用双并行路径：因果卷积捕获局部位置相关上下文，关联记忆检索机制建模全局内容模式，通过门控机制动态融合两种信息

Result: 在WikiText-2和TinyStories数据集上，GAM训练速度显著快于Transformer和Mamba，验证困惑度达到同等或更优水平

Conclusion: GAM作为线性复杂度的序列建模架构，在效率和性能上都表现出色，是Transformer的有前景替代方案

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

*Md Tanzib Hosain,Md Kishor Morol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了ICPC基准测试，包含254个编程竞赛题目，通过多轮自判断、反思和检索等技术，将语言模型在编程竞赛中的解决率从19.1%提升到42.2%，并发现人类简单指导可以显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程任务需要复杂的算法思维和代码创作能力，但作为评估语言模型的领域尚未得到足够关注，需要建立专门的基准来测试和提升语言模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建包含254个ICPC题目的基准测试，每个题目包含官方分析、参考代码和测试用例。采用零样本思维链提示、多轮自判断与反思、检索等技术来提升语言模型的编程问题解决能力。

Result: 零样本思维链提示下模型仅达到19.1%的解决率，而最佳推理技术（多轮自判断+反思+检索）将解决率提升至42.2%。人类简单指导可以帮助模型解决之前无法解决的17/18个问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发具有扎实、创新和算法思维能力的语言模型迈出了重要一步，证明了结合人类指导的推理技术能显著提升模型在复杂编程任务中的表现，相关代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

*Sanjeeevan Selvaganapathy,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现经过安全对齐的LLM在仇恨言论检测上表现优于未对齐模型，但存在意识形态偏见和公平性问题，所有模型在理解讽刺等细微语言时都存在严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在检测隐性和显性仇恨言论方面的有效性，比较经过安全对齐（censored）和未对齐（uncensored）模型在分类能力上的客观性差异。

Method: 通过对比实验分析不同安全对齐程度的LLM在仇恨言论检测任务中的表现，评估其准确性、鲁棒性、意识形态一致性以及对不同目标群体的公平性。

Result: 对齐模型在准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于未对齐模型（78.7% vs 64.1%），但对齐模型具有强烈的意识形态锚定效应，未对齐模型则容易受到意识形态框架的影响。所有模型在理解讽刺等细微语言时都存在严重失败，且存在明显的公平性差异和系统性过度自信问题。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LLM作为客观仲裁者的观念，强调需要开发更复杂的审计框架来考虑公平性、校准性和意识形态一致性，不能单纯依赖模型的安全对齐状态来判断其客观性。

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Router Upcycling技术，通过从注意力头初始化多个路由器来增强MoE上循环模型的性能，实现SOTA结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练效率低，现有简单路由器在复杂路由任务中表现不佳，需要改进MoE上循环技术的路由能力

Method: 在MoE上循环过程中，从前面的注意力层注意力头初始化多个路由器，这些路由器以类似注意力的方式协作将token分配给专业专家

Result: 实验结果表明该方法实现了最先进的性能，优于其他上循环基线方法

Conclusion: Router Upcycling技术有效提升了MoE上循环模型的性能，为高效训练MoE模型提供了新思路

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

### [32] [Do small language models generate realistic variable-quality fake news headlines?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00680)
*Austin McCutcheon,Chris Brogly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了14个小语言模型(SLMs)在生成虚假新闻标题方面的能力，发现这些模型普遍配合度高，但生成的标题质量检测准确率较低(35.2%-63.5%)，表明生成的假新闻与真实人类撰写的内容差异较大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估小语言模型(SLMs)生成虚假新闻标题的潜在风险，以及这些生成内容是否与真实新闻标题相似，从而了解SLMs在虚假信息传播中的潜在威胁。

Method: 使用14个SLMs模型(1.7B-14B参数)，通过受控提示工程生成24,000个低质量和高质量虚假新闻标题，然后应用现有的机器学习检测模型(DistilBERT和bagging分类器)进行质量检测分析。

Result: SLMs表现出高配合率，伦理约束有限；质量检测准确率仅为35.2%-63.5%，误分类现象普遍；生成的假新闻标题与真实人类撰写内容相似度较低。

Conclusion: 测试的SLMs普遍能够配合生成虚假标题，但生成的假新闻质量较低，与真实内容差异明显，现有检测模型对其识别准确率有限。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态时间序列预测方法依赖高质量文本输入，但实际中文本可能无法准确捕捉时间序列信息，导致性能不稳定，需要增强文本内容来改善预测效果

Conclusion: 通过强化文本模态可以有效提升多模态时间序列预测的性能，文本强化模型和强化学习方法的结合能够产生高质量的强化文本并改善预测效果

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

Abstract: Probing with sparse autoencoders is a promising approach for uncovering
interpretable features in large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
automated evaluation methods has hindered their broader adoption and
development. In this work, we introduce CE-Bench, a novel and lightweight
contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders, built on a curated
dataset of contrastive story pairs. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench
reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well
with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RevBrowse是一个基于大语言模型的评论驱动推荐框架，通过PrefRAG模块自适应检索相关评论来解决评论利用效率低和缺乏动态优先级机制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推荐任务中表现出色，但在评论推荐中面临两个挑战：受限于上下文窗口无法高效利用用户评论，以及缺乏有效机制来优先处理与用户当前决策最相关的评论。

Method: 提出RevBrowse框架，受"浏览-决策"过程启发，将用户评论整合到LLM重排序过程中。引入PrefRAG检索增强模块，将用户和物品表示解耦为结构化形式，并根据目标物品自适应检索偏好相关内容。

Result: 在四个Amazon评论数据集上的实验表明，RevBrowse相比强基线实现了持续显著的改进，展现了其在建模动态用户偏好方面的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RevBrowse不仅提升了推荐性能，还通过透明的检索过程提供了一定程度的可解释性，使影响最终推荐的评论可见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

TL;DR: 提出了Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS)解码策略，通过奖励模型提供全局信号来改善掩码扩散模型的非自回归生成顺序和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准置信度采样方法在掩码扩散模型中会导致类似自回归的生成顺序，限制了非自回归建模的优势

Method: RWS在扩散过程的每一步使用外部奖励模型评估整个中间序列质量，并相应缩放token对数概率，通过全局序列一致性指导token选择

Result: 实验表明RWS显著促进了非自回归生成顺序，在多个评估指标上都有改进

Conclusion: 整合全局信号能有效增强掩码扩散模型的非自回归特性和整体性能

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

Abstract: Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized,
scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study
introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a
design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five
phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical
principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The
resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

TL;DR: 本研究系统比较了编码器Transformer、解码器LLM和FastText在中文AI生成文本检测任务上的表现，发现LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B模型达到95.94%的测试准确率，表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，准确检测AI生成文本的需求日益增长，特别是在中文这种语言细微差别对现有方法构成重大挑战的语言中。

Method: 使用NLPCC 2025中文AI生成文本检测数据集，系统比较了编码器模型（Chinese BERT-large和RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large）、解码器模型（Qwen2.5-7B通过LoRA微调）和FastText基线方法。编码器模型采用基于提示的掩码语言建模方法微调，解码器模型使用指令格式输入和轻量级分类头。

Result: 编码器模型在分布偏移下性能显著下降（RoBERTa: 76.3%，BERT: 79.3%），FastText表现出词汇鲁棒性（83.5%）但缺乏深层语义理解，而LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B达到95.94%的测试准确率，表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明基于解码器的大语言模型结合参数高效微调在中文AI生成文本检测中具有显著优势，未来将探索新一代Qwen3模型、蒸馏变体和集成策略以进一步提升跨域鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

Motivation: 现有基于问题分解的方法生成的问题往往不相关且不完整，导致检索中事实丢失，且无法聚合来自不同文档和段落的证据片段。

Method: 使用上下文增强的两阶段忠实分解方法分解长答案为子事实，检索相关证据片段，在证据冲突时修订子事实，最后按原句聚合证据。

Result: 在六个数据集上评估，提出了新的证据精度指标$Attr_{auto-P}$，FIDES在GPT-3.5-turbo、Gemini和Llama 70B系列上平均优于SOTA方法超过14%。

Conclusion: FIDES通过忠实的事实分解和证据聚合，有效解决了现有方法在问题生成和证据聚合方面的不足，显著提升了归因问答的性能。

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将司法意见生成分为法律推理和量刑预测两个独立子任务，导致推理与预测不一致，且依赖人工整理知识，实用性有限。

Method: 提出LegalChainReasoner框架，使用结构化法律链整合事实前提、复合法律条件和量刑结论，实现灵活知识注入和端到端意见生成。

Result: 在两个真实世界的中文法律案例数据集上实验表明，该方法优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法更好地符合司法实践需求，实现了法律推理与量刑决策的一致性生成。

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在生物医学和医疗保健应用中的部署需要对其复杂问答能力进行严格评估，特别是在涉及疾病、基因和化学物质的多跳生物医学问答任务中。

Method: 采用监督微调策略，使用LLaMA 3 8B模型，结合来自BioASQ、MedQuAD和TREC的外部生物医学问答数据集。探索了三种实验设置：短长答案联合微调、仅短答案微调和仅长答案微调。

Result: 模型在概念级准确度得分达到0.8，但在精确匹配(EM)得分方面表现较差，特别是在测试阶段。引入两阶段推理管道改善了答案提取，但在严格格式化输出方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了生物医学LLM应用中语义理解与精确答案评估之间的差距，需要进一步研究输出控制和后处理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Conclusion: TMT为跨语言主题模型重用提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于目标语言语料库有限或人工翻译不可行的情况

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了在DSTC-12挑战赛中开发的小型模型（少于130亿参数）用于对话系统评估的方法，包括基于提示的语言模型和编码器分类回归模型，结果显示虽然语言模型提示方法相关性一般但排名第二，而小参数模型在验证集上某些维度表现良好但测试集性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI对话系统的增多，如何有效评估这些系统成为一个重要挑战。本文旨在通过DSTC-12挑战赛解决对话级别、维度特定评分的预测问题，并在使用相对小型模型的约束下探索有效的评估方法。

Method: 采用两种主要策略：1）通过提示方式使用语言模型作为评估器；2）训练基于编码器的分类和回归模型。所有模型都控制在130亿参数以内的小规模。

Result: 语言模型提示方法与人判断的相关性一般，但在测试集上排名第二，仅被基线方法超越。分类和回归模型参数更少，在验证集上某些维度显示出高相关性，但在测试集上性能下降，主要因为测试集的评分范围与训练验证集有显著差异。

Conclusion: 小型模型在对话系统评估中具有一定潜力，但测试集分布差异对模型性能影响较大。语言模型提示方法虽然相关性不高但相对稳定，而小参数模型在特定条件下表现良好但泛化能力有待提升。

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

Motivation: 传统文本嵌入模型使用三元组对比学习，负样本对区分语义细微差别至关重要，需要更有效的负样本生成策略

Method: MGH框架用LLM生成不同相似度的多样化负样本，支持从粗到细的课程学习；ATA池化方法基于LLM聚合模式给锚定token更高权重

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越现有合成策略，在合成数据和公共检索数据集上都表现优异

Conclusion: 多粒度困难负样本生成和锚定token感知池化能有效提升文本嵌入模型的语义表示能力

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型作为强大的创意工具，存在放大有害社会偏见风险，需要系统评估和解决这些模型的代表性社会偏见问题。

Method: 构建包含5种职业角色的试点基准，使用5个最先进的模型（包括闭源和开源模型），比较中性提示与公平性控制提示的效果，对所有输出进行性别和种族标注以进行结构化分布分析。

Result: 提示工程可以显著改变人口统计特征的表示，但效果高度模型依赖：有些系统能有效多样化，有些会过度校正导致不切实际的统一性，有些则响应性很低。

Conclusion: 提示工程作为公平性干预措施既有希望也有局限性，强调了需要结合模型层面策略的必要性，所有代码和数据已公开以确保透明度和可重复性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

TL;DR: 本文提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法来缓解大语言模型中的奉承幻觉问题，通过对比诱导欺骗性输入和中性输入的输出分布差异，在不需额外训练的情况下提高生成内容的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对欺骗性和误导性提示时会产生奉承幻觉，即优先与输入的隐含视角对齐而非保持准确性，这影响了模型输出的真实性和可靠性。

Method: 设计两种范式生成欺骗性/误导性输入来诱导一致的奉承幻觉，然后提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法，通过对比诱导输入和转换中性输入的输出分布偏差来减少对欺骗信息的依赖。

Result: 大量实验表明，CCD方法能有效缓解奉承幻觉，在各种任务中提高生成响应的真实性。

Conclusion: 协作对比解码是一种有效的奉承幻觉缓解方法，无需额外训练即可改善大语言模型输出的准确性，在多种NLP任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG是一个创新的检索增强生成框架，通过结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，使用支持性证据笔记(SENs)来提炼关键信息，并通过证据质量奖励(EQR)提升推理准确性，在多个QA基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-回答范式存在两个主要问题：(1)检索证据中信号噪声比低，有用信息被无关内容淹没；(2)多跳推理中错误累积。需要一种能有效过滤噪声、提升推理准确性的方法。

Method: 提出结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，训练模型生成简洁的支持性证据笔记(SENs)，仅保留答案相关信息并标注不确定性。引入基于蕴含的证据质量奖励(EQR)来评估SENs对最终答案的逻辑支持。

Result: 在领域内和领域外QA基准测试中，EviNote-RAG在准确性、泛化性和训练稳定性方面均优于强基线方法，在HotpotQA上相对F1提升20%(+0.093)，Bamboogle提升40%(+0.151)，2Wiki提升91%(+0.256)。

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG通过SENs和EQR的结合，实现了更忠实和鲁棒的推理，同时减少了噪声影响，在保持高效的同时达到了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺、反讽和挖苦通常用于表达幽默和批评，但有时会被误认为是事实报道，类似于假新闻。这些技术可以在更细粒度的句子级别应用，因此需要专门的检测方法。

Method: 创建了包含13,873个手动标注句子的罗马尼亚语数据集SeLeRoSa，涵盖多个领域。评估了基于LLM的基线模型在零样本和微调设置下的表现，以及基于transformer的基线模型。

Result: 研究发现当前大型语言模型在句子级讽刺检测任务上存在局限性，即使在零样本和微调设置下表现也不理想。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了现有模型在细粒度讽刺检测方面的不足，为新的研究方向铺平了道路，强调了需要开发更专门的技术来处理此类自然语言理解任务。

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了监督上下文微调(SIFT)方法，将序列标注任务转化为生成式LLMs更自然的约束响应生成问题，显著超越了传统方法和解码器作为编码器的微调基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列标注任务通常使用编码器模型处理，但因果LLMs在生成式序列标注方面研究较少。由于LLMs快速发展，预期其性能将超过停滞发展的编码器模型。

Method: 提出SIFT方法，结合上下文学习(ICL)和监督微调，将序列标注任务重新表述为约束响应生成问题，更适合因果LLMs的自然处理方式。

Result: SIFT在多个标准序列标注任务上显著优于ICL和解码器作为编码器微调基线。研究发现长上下文会降低性能，但移除指令可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 生成式任务表述对于LLMs在序列标注任务中的有效性能至关重要，研究揭示了LLMs在序列标注中的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

Motivation: 解决医学翻译中专业术语和领域知识不足的问题，通过整合结构化医学知识来增强大语言模型的翻译能力

Method: 构建2999句平行语料库和100句测试集，使用UMLS和LLM-KB知识设计结构化提示，结合LoRA微调在4个开源LLM上进行实验

Result: 所有模型翻译质量显著提升，Phi-4模型达到BLEU 44.23、chrF++ 28.91、COMET 0.863，超越GPT-4o等基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化知识整合能有效提升LLM在医学翻译任务中的表现，MedCOD提示和模型适配均对性能提升有独立贡献

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

Conclusion: 通过结构和解构的协同作用，可以构建支持透明、可控和适应性智能系统的通用知识引擎，为NLP领域提供了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 偏好优化与质量驱动细化相结合，为构建更可靠、临床基础的医疗LLMs提供了可扩展且有效的方法

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在理解特定文化沟通规范方面存在困难，特别是在波斯taarof这种强调谦逊、尊重和间接性的复杂礼仪系统方面，现有文化基准测试中完全缺失这方面的评估。

Method: 创建包含450个角色扮演场景的TaarofBench基准，涵盖12个常见社交互动主题，由母语者验证。评估了5个前沿LLM，并通过监督微调和直接偏好优化方法来提升模型表现。

Result: 前沿LLM在taarof文化适当场景中的准确率比母语者低40-48%，性能随互动主题变化，波斯语提示能改善表现，且存在性别不对称性。微调方法分别实现了21.8%和42.3%的文化对齐改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发多样化且具有文化意识的大语言模型奠定了基础，表明需要超越西方礼貌框架的文化评估标准，以支持模型在复杂社交互动中的更好应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 危机沟通中语言模型自动响应的风格一致性对建立受影响人群的信任至关重要，但现有研究很少关注如何保持跨响应风格的一致性

Method: 提出基于新评估指标的两阶段融合生成方法：先评估候选响应的风格，然后通过实例级融合过程优化和整合，生成高质量且风格一致的响应

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在响应质量和风格一致性方面均优于基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升危机沟通中自动响应的风格一致性，有助于建立受影响人群对响应者的信任

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

Method: 使用包含1000个多选题的基准测试，涵盖多样化的继承场景，测试模型理解继承背景和计算伊斯兰法学规定的份额分配能力。

Result: o3和Gemini 2.5准确率超过90%，表现优异；ALLaM、Fanar、LLaMA和Mistral准确率低于50%，表现较差。错误分析显示模型存在继承场景误解、法律规则应用错误和领域知识不足等问题。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在伊斯兰法律推理方面存在显著局限性，特别是在结构化法律推理方面，需要改进领域适应能力和推理机制。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

TL;DR: 乌尔都语中-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代语法中极不合法，尽管19世纪文献中自由存在，这种范式空缺源于形态句法冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乌尔都语动词和体组合中的范式空缺现象，特别是-ya: kar结构的完成体形式从19世纪到现代的语法变化。

Method: 通过历史文本分析、大规模语料库研究和母语者主观评价任务，确认完成体形式的缺失和不可接受性。

Result: 发现完成体形式在现代乌尔都语中极不自然，这种空缺源于名词性主语要求与及物完成体赋予作格的核心语法规则冲突。

Conclusion: 形态句法冲突导致完成体形式不稳定，被其他结构功能替代后，这种空缺在现代语法中得以巩固。

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

TL;DR: DistilledPRAG是一种隐私保护的参数化RAG模型，通过知识蒸馏将文档编码为LoRA参数，在保持RAG性能的同时避免原始文档泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前RAG系统需要上传明文文档到云端导致的隐私泄露问题，以及现有参数化RAG方法在推理延迟和泛化性能上的不足。

Method: 首先合成单文档和多文档的QA对增强跨文档推理，然后用特殊标记屏蔽明文文档并通过参数生成器转换为LoRA参数，最后通过知识蒸馏训练参数生成器以匹配标准RAG的隐藏状态和输出logits。

Result: 在四个QA数据集上的实验表明，DistilledPRAG在准确率上优于基线方法，并在分布外数据上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG成功实现了高效参数化同时保持RAG级别性能，为隐私保护推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

TL;DR: REFRAG是一个针对RAG应用的高效解码框架，通过压缩、感知和扩展技术，利用检索上下文的稀疏性结构，在保持性能的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG应用中，LLM处理的检索上下文大部分内容与查询无关，存在计算冗余，导致系统延迟高和内存需求大，需要专门优化。

Method: 提出REFRAG框架，利用检索上下文的块对角注意力模式稀疏性，通过压缩、感知和扩展技术来消除不必要的计算。

Result: 实现了30.85倍的首词时间加速（相比之前工作提升3.75倍），无困惑度损失，并能将LLM上下文大小扩展16倍。

Conclusion: REFRAG在多种长上下文任务中都能提供显著的速度提升，且不影响准确性，是RAG应用的有效优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Motivation: 探究自然演变的上下文段落如何影响生成式大型语言模型在问答任务中的表现，分析文本演变对模型理解能力的影响。

Method: 提出一个框架来整理自然演变的人工编辑变体阅读段落，基于语义相似度评分分析多个LLM在六个QA数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验显示LLM性能随着阅读段落与预训练版本相似度降低而显著下降，BoolQ数据集上准确率从最高到最低相似度区间下降超过30%。

Conclusion: 自然文本演变对LLM的语言理解能力构成重大挑战，模型对训练数据中见过的文本变体存在过度依赖。

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training

Conclusion: 提出的实体对齐翻译方法能够有效解决非拉丁语系语言在跨语言NER中的性能问题

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse

a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in
different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Conclusion: SAT框架有效解决了表示空间不一致和指令设计冗余问题，为LLM在知识图谱补全中的应用提供了高效统一的解决方案

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long

However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context

Conclusion: 该框架为系统管理解释性歧义提供了初步解决方案，是构建更稳健、遵循规则的AI系统的重要一步

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual

### [71] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning through Model Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01213)
*Ege Süalp,Mina Rezaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于模型增长策略（特别是transformer堆叠）在缓解大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题方面的效果。研究发现增长训练模型在阅读理解和推理任务上表现出更好的知识保留能力，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的主要挑战，大语言模型在微调新任务时会丢失先前学到的知识。模型增长策略通过利用小模型来加速和结构化大模型训练，但其对遗忘问题的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于增长的预训练方法（transformer堆叠），比较增长训练模型（Stack LLM）和传统训练模型（LLM）在一系列微调任务（领域知识、推理、阅读理解、偏见评估）上的表现。

Result: 两种模型在领域知识上都有提升，但推理和阅读理解能力随时间退化。Stack LLM退化程度更小，特别是在阅读理解方面。在偏见评估中，基线LLM变得更中性，而Stack LLM保持60-61%的稳定偏见比例。

Conclusion: 基于增长的预训练在抵抗灾难性遗忘方面能带来适度改进，但在处理社会偏见方面仍存在权衡，需要进一步研究来平衡知识保留和偏见控制。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DaMoC框架通过数据和模型压缩技术，快速选择最优LLM进行微调，节省20倍训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务表现出色但领域特定任务表现不佳，需要微调。面对众多开源LLM，如何快速选择最优模型进行下游任务微调是一个挑战

Method: 1) 数据层面：建立数据过滤方法分类（分布感知、质量感知、混合方法），增强关键token密度实现token压缩，使用LLM迭代重写文本优化表达；2) 模型层面：使用层相似性评分评估各层重要性并移除低重要性层，引入稀疏合并范式保留原始模型能力

Result: 在医疗问答、金融问答、通用问答和阅读理解四个数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法可以在节省约20倍训练时间的同时选择出最优LLM

Conclusion: DaMoC框架有效解决了LLM选择难题，通过数据和模型压缩技术显著提升了微调效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

TL;DR: 本文从上下文学习与预训练先验的双重关系角度探索Chain-of-Thought推理的工作机制，通过细粒度词汇分析、噪声样本引入和提示工程实验，揭示了模型如何平衡预训练先验与上下文信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Chain-of-Thought推理方法日益受到关注，但其底层工作机制仍不清楚，需要从上下文学习与预训练先验的交互角度进行深入探索。

Method: 采用三层研究方法：1）对推理过程进行细粒度词汇级分析；2）逐步引入噪声样本来检验模型如何平衡预训练先验与错误上下文信息；3）研究提示工程是否能诱导大语言模型进行慢思考。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：1）模型能快速学习推理结构和深层逻辑模式，但严重依赖预训练先验；2）足够样本使决策从预训练先验转向上下文信号，误导提示带来不稳定性；3）长推理链提示能诱导生成更长推理链，提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought推理的有效性源于模型在预训练先验和上下文学习之间的动态平衡，提示工程可以诱导更深入的推理过程，为理解和改进推理能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨基于评估方法标注的工业语料中的情感表达，发现标注存在显著分歧但遵循稳定统计趋势，通过语言模型证明可以建模标注过程且变异性由语言特征驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感在人类社会运作中至关重要，但文本情感表达仍是一个开放领域。传统方法存在局限，评估方法提供了不同视角，但标注存在显著分歧，需要验证其是否遵循统计规律。

Method: 使用基于评估方法手动标注的工业语料，训练语言模型来分析标注过程，探究标注变异性与底层语言特征的关系。

Result: 语言模型能够成功建模标注过程，标注变异性主要由底层语言特征驱动，同时语言模型能够基于评估标准区分情感情境。

Conclusion: 尽管人工标注存在分歧，但遵循稳定统计趋势，评估方法为情感分析提供了有效框架，语言模型在情感识别方面展现出潜力。

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

TL;DR: 本文主张采用"有意文化评估"方法，系统性地检查评估中嵌入的文化假设，超越当前以静态事实为中心的评估范式，强调研究者立场性和参与式方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM文化对齐评估的"琐事中心范式"过于简化文化为静态事实，忽视了文化的多元性和互动性本质，无法适应先进模型的实际部署需求。

Method: 提出系统性分析评估中文化因素的方法框架，包括识别文化假设的出现情境、强调研究者立场性，以及采用HCI启发的参与式评估设计方法。

Result: 建立了文化评估的新理论框架，揭示了当前评估方法中隐含的文化偏见，为开发更包容、文化对齐的NLP研究提供了指导原则。

Conclusion: 需要从根本上重新思考文化评估范式，采用有意文化评估方法，通过社区参与和研究者反思来构建更公正、包容的评估体系。

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

TL;DR: TableZoomer是一个基于LLM的程序化代理框架，通过结构化表模式、查询感知缩放机制和程序思维策略，显著提升了表格问答任务的性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在表格问答任务中面临的结构异构性、目标数据定位困难和复杂推理瓶颈等工业应用挑战。

Method: 采用三个关键创新：1）用结构化表模式替代完全文本化表格；2）查询感知表缩放机制动态生成子表模式；3）程序思维策略将查询转换为可执行代码。结合ReAct范式实现迭代推理。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B-Instruct上，TableZoomer在DataBench数据集上比传统PoT方法准确率提升19.34%，在TableBench的事实检查任务上提升25%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持可用性优势的同时，显著提升了不同规模表格的性能和可扩展性，为工业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨如何利用参数高效微调技术(PEFTs)解决大语言模型在低资源领域适应性问题，通过在丰富资源数据集上训练适配器来提升未见低资源领域的文本摘要性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然是通用任务解决器，但在新领域适应能力有限，特别是在低资源且无标注数据的领域。传统微调方法计算成本高且耗时，需要更高效的领域适应方案。

Method: 使用6种参数高效微调技术(PEFTs)在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上，基于科学、医疗、法律和新闻等14个训练数据集进行文本摘要任务实验，探索领域内适配器和跨领域适配器的使用策略。

Result: 实验表明，对于低资源领域，使用领域内适配器的推理性能优于少样本学习，甚至优于更大的Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型。在没有领域内适配器时，跨领域适配器及其策略组合能利用语言相似性提升适应性。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调技术能有效解决大语言模型在低资源领域的适应问题，通过领域内和跨领域适配器的策略使用，可以在计算资源有限的情况下实现更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

Motivation: 现有法律基准无法评估开放式和基于法律条款的问答，需要专门针对多跳法律推理的评估框架

Method: 构建包含226个场景问答的KoBLEX基准，提出ParSeR方法通过生成参数化条款进行三阶段检索，并设计LF-Eval自动评估指标

Result: ParSeR相比标准检索方法在GPT-4o上F1分数提升37.91，LF-Eval分数提升30.81，在不同推理深度上表现一致

Conclusion: KoBLEX基准和ParSeR方法有效解决了基于法律条款的多跳推理评估问题，LF-Eval指标与人工评估高度相关

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的复杂推理能力通常需要昂贵的强化学习优化，本研究旨在探索如何将已习得的推理能力以紧凑向量形式提取并复用，降低计算成本。

Method: 从相同初始化的Qwen2.5模型中提取推理向量v_reason = θ_GRPO - θ_SFT，然后将该向量通过简单算术加法应用到兼容的指令调优模型中。

Result: 推理向量在多个基准测试中显著提升性能：GSM8K (+4.9%)、HumanEval (+4.3%)、SciQ (+1.7%)、BigBenchHard (+12.3%)，且在对抗条件下性能提升依然保持。向量减法导致性能显著下降(-11.8%)。

Conclusion: 推理能力可以通过简单的张量算术从现有开源模型中提取和复用，为回收先前计算投资提供实用方法，显著降低模型增强的计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

TL;DR: 提出了一个领域无关的框架，用于自动评估和人工标注跨文档链接，在新闻和同行评审领域验证了检索模型与LLM结合的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档关系理解对许多应用领域至关重要，但缺乏高效的方法来创建训练和评估数据集，限制了自动化辅助的研究

Method: 首先生成和验证半合成的互连文档数据集，进行自动评估筛选出最佳链接方法，然后在自然文本对上开展广泛的人工评估研究

Result: 在新闻和同行评审两个领域应用该框架，结合检索模型和LLM的方法获得了78%的人工评分链接批准率，比单独使用检索器的精度提高了一倍多

Conclusion: 该框架支持跨应用场景的系统性跨文档理解研究，生成的新数据集为媒体框架分析和同行评审等任务奠定了基础

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

Motivation: 研究神经音频编解码器生成的离散语音标记的统计语言学特性，探索这些标记如何遵循Zipf定律和Heaps定律等语言统计规律，以及这些特性与语音合成质量的关系

Method: 分析多种NAC模型产生的离散语音标记，检查其对Zipf定律和Heaps定律的遵循程度，计算熵和冗余度，使用自动语音识别的错误率评估可懂度，使用UTMOS分数评估质量

Result: NAC标记特别是3-grams展现出类似语言的统计模式，这些统计特性和信息含量测量与语音识别和重合成任务的性能改进相关

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了NAC标记序列的结构特征，为设计更有效的生成式语音模型提供了重要见解

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学应用题上表现优异，但在元推理任务（如识别学生解决方案中的错误）方面存在困难，特别是定位步骤式解决方案中的首个错误步骤。

Method: 使用VtG和PRM800K两个错误推理数据集进行实验，提出生成中间修正学生解决方案的方法，该方法与原始学生解决方案更接近对齐。

Result: 实验表明，即使提供参考解决方案，最先进的大型语言模型也难以准确定位学生解决方案中的首个错误步骤。提出的方法有助于提高性能。

Conclusion: 通过生成与原始学生解决方案更接近对齐的中间修正方案，可以有效改善大型语言模型在定位错误步骤方面的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的思维链推理过程不透明，难以在高风险场景中进行验证、调试和控制，需要更可靠和可理解的推理方法

Method: 开发Vis-CoT框架，将线性CoT文本转换为交互式推理图，支持用户可视化逻辑流程、识别错误步骤、修剪错误路径和嫁接新前提

Result: 在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上，Vis-CoT相比非交互式基线将最终答案准确率提升了最高24个百分点，用户研究显示可用性和信任度大幅提升

Conclusion: Vis-CoT通过结合LLM与针对性人类监督，为实现更可靠、可理解和协作的推理提供了一条实用路径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

TL;DR: 本研究创建了一个基于世界价值观调查的评估框架，系统评估LLMs在不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况，发现LLMs仅与少数国家意见适当或过度对齐，而与大多数国家意见对齐不足。通过改变提示语言可以更有效地引导LLMs与对应国家意见对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注美国或少数国家的人口群体意见，缺乏全球国家样本、不同历史时期人类意见研究，以及使用语言引导LLMs的讨论，同时忽视了提示语言对LLMs意见对齐的潜在影响。

Method: 基于世界价值观调查(WVS)创建评估框架，系统评估LLMs在全球不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况。

Result: LLMs仅与少数国家意见适当或过度对齐，而与大多数国家意见对齐不足。改变提示语言比现有引导方法更有效地使LLMs与对应国家意见对齐。LLMs更符合当代人群意见。

Conclusion: 这是首个在全球、语言和时间维度上全面调查LLMs意见对齐主题的研究，填补了现有研究的空白，提供了评估框架和公开的代码数据。

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: UniCR是一个统一框架，将多种不确定性证据转化为校准的正确概率，并通过原则性拒绝来执行用户指定的错误预算，提高语言模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署的语言模型需要决定何时不回答，以避免错误回答。现有方法在处理异构不确定性证据和提供分布无关保证方面存在不足。

Method: 使用温度缩放和适当评分学习轻量级校准头，支持仅API模型的黑盒特征，通过符合风险控制提供分布无关保证。对于长文本生成，通过检索证据监督原子事实性得分来对齐置信度与语义保真度。

Result: 在短问答、代码生成和检索增强的长问答实验中，校准指标持续改进，风险-覆盖率曲线下面积降低，固定风险下覆盖率更高。

Conclusion: UniCR提供了一个从证据融合到校准概率再到风险控制决策的可移植方案，无需微调基础模型且在分布偏移下保持有效，显著提高了模型可信度。

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练后知识静态化，传统知识编辑方法要么过度依赖表面线索，要么在噪声多跳条件下性能崩溃，需要更可靠的知识更新方法。

Method: 提出端到端的推理链编辑框架，包含事实确认、相关性判断、选择性应用和最终推理四个结构化阶段，在单次处理中过滤干扰信息。

Result: 在MQuAKE-CF数据集上，Reason-KE将Qwen2.5-7B的多跳问答准确率提升至90.2%，在强干扰下仅下降6.3%，答案泄露时下降<1%。

Conclusion: Reason-KE在可靠性和效率方面建立了新的最先进水平，为大语言模型的知识更新提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型会产生事实错误的幻觉，研究者主要使用检索增强语言模型和拒绝后训练两种方法，但当前研究忽视了RALMs拒绝能力的评估，需要探究RALMs是否知道何时不知道。

Method: 通过研究不同内部和外部知识状态下RALMs的校准情况，分析各种影响因素；研究拒绝感知指令调优和上下文微调方法对过度拒绝问题的影响；开发简单有效的拒绝方法来提升拒绝后训练模型的整体答案质量。

Result: 发现LLMs表现出显著的过度拒绝行为；上下文微调缓解了过度拒绝问题，但R-tuning放大了该问题；拒绝能力可能与答案质量存在冲突。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对RALM系统中重要影响因素影响的更全面理解，开发的方法能有效提升拒绝后训练模型的整体答案质量。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用简单的top-k语义搜索，经常包含不相关或冗余信息，导致性能下降和效率低下。

Method: MeVe采用五阶段模块化设计：初始检索、相关性验证、备用检索、上下文优先级排序和token预算，实现细粒度控制和任务依赖的过滤。

Result: 在Wikipedia数据集上实现57%的上下文减少，在更复杂的HotpotQA数据集上实现75%的减少，显著提高了上下文效率。

Conclusion: MeVe为更可扩展和可靠的LLM应用提供了框架，通过精炼和蒸馏上下文信息，实现了更好的基础支持和更准确的事实支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨不同历史时期和组织背景下社区工会主义的连续性和普遍性假设，通过比较分析验证社区工会主义核心特征在不同时代工会中的体现程度。

Method: 采用BERTopic主题建模和cTF-IDF加权方法，结合词频分析，对两个工会的档案文本进行话语特征比较分析。

Result: Unite Community显示出更强的外向型、社会正义导向主题，而国家靴鞋工会更强调内部管理、产业关系和会员服务，体现了传统服务型工会模式。

Conclusion: 虽然两个工会都涉及社区相关主题，但其参与模式存在显著差异，挑战了社区工会主义跨时间和跨部门的连续性和普遍性假设，同时证明现代NLP技术可以有效增强历史劳工档案研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得显著成功，但往往捕捉的是伪相关性而非真实因果关系，导致在分布外场景下性能不佳。需要探索LLMs如何有效利用因果知识进行预测和生成。

Method: 提出Causal Attention Tuning (CAT)方法：1）自动化流水线利用人类先验自动生成token级因果信号；2）引入Re-Attention机制指导训练，使模型关注因果结构并减轻注意力分数中的噪声和偏差。

Result: 在提出的Spurious Token Game (STG)基准测试和多个下游任务上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效利用因果知识进行预测，并在OOD场景下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAT方法成功将因果知识注入LLMs的注意力机制，显著提升了模型在因果推理和OOD泛化方面的能力，为解决LLMs的伪相关问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度增加，基于LLM的工具代理难以正确识别和按顺序调用API，需要更好的方法来理解API依赖关系。

Method: 将API文档转换为结构化API图，构建专家标注的In-N-Out数据集，包含API依赖关系和组合调用信息。

Result: 使用In-N-Out数据集后，工具检索和多工具查询生成性能几乎翻倍，微调模型能弥补90%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 显式API图对工具代理具有重要价值，In-N-Out数据集是理解API文档和参数关系的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在RLHF后经常表现出过度自信，生成看似合理但错误的答案，这给可靠的uncertainty estimation和安全部署带来了挑战。

Method: 提出EAGLE方法，从LLM自评估过程中的多个中间层提取内部信念，聚合这些层级信念并计算置信度分数分布的期望值，生成更准确的置信度分数。

Result: 在多样化数据集和LLM上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE显著优于现有基线方法，大幅提升了校准性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过利用LLM内部隐藏状态来获得更准确的置信度评估，为解决LLM过度自信问题提供了有效的解决方案，有助于模型的安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

Motivation: 探究句子嵌入空间中的几何距离是否能够反映句子嵌入在各类任务上的相对性能表现，验证词嵌入空间中的距离-语义相似性关系是否适用于句子级别

Method: 采用三种方式计算句子嵌入：平均词嵌入、特殊[CLS]标记嵌入、随机词标记嵌入，分析不同句子嵌入变体之间的距离与其在语言任务上性能的相关性

Result: 余弦相似度只能捕捉句子嵌入之间的浅层共性或差异，这些差异不能预测在具体任务上的性能表现。语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合编码的，而不是反映在句子嵌入空间的几何结构中

Conclusion: 句子嵌入空间的几何结构不能作为预测句子嵌入性能的可靠指标，语言信息的编码方式比简单的几何距离关系更加复杂和深层

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个检测AI生成现代中文诗歌的新基准，构建了包含人类创作和AI生成诗歌的高质量数据集，并验证了现有检测器在识别AI生成诗歌方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，AI生成的文本与人类写作难以区分。现代中文诗歌具有独特特征，AI生成诗歌的泛滥严重扰乱了诗歌生态系统，迫切需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 首先构建高质量数据集，包含6位专业诗人创作的800首诗歌和4个主流LLM生成的41,600首诗歌。随后系统评估了6个检测器在该数据集上的性能表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前检测器无法可靠检测LLM生成的现代中文诗歌，最难检测的诗意特征是内在品质（尤其是风格）。检测结果验证了所提出基准的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: 本研究为未来AI生成诗歌的检测奠定了基础，证明了现有检测工具在现代中文诗歌识别方面的不足，强调了开发专门检测方法的迫切需求。

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

TL;DR: TransGAT是一种结合Transformer和GNN的自动作文评分新方法，通过双流预测和语法依赖关系建模，在分析性评分维度上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工评分耗时且不一致，现有自动评分方法使用静态词嵌入无法捕捉上下文语义，且多采用整体评分而忽略具体写作维度

Method: 将微调后的Transformer模型(BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTaV3)与图注意力网络(GAT)结合，第一流生成文章级预测，第二流在Transformer词嵌入上应用GAT并构建语法依赖边，最后融合两流预测

Result: 在ELLIPSE数据集上，TransGAT平均二次加权Kappa达到0.854，优于基线模型

Conclusion: TransGAT展示了结合Transformer上下文理解能力和GNN关系建模优势的潜力，可推动自动作文评分系统发展

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

Motivation: 需要一种高效的方法来计算词语之间的语音相似度，以分析语言的语音结构，传统方法在处理大规模数据集时效率不足

Method: 使用Needleman-Wunsch算法计算语音转录的相似度，用Rust实现并利用CUDA和cudarc库进行GPU并行化加速，构建全连接图并通过聚类算法识别语音相似的词语组

Result: 实现了显著的性能提升，验证了该方法在分析语言语音结构方面的可行性和有效性，能够高效处理大规模数据集

Conclusion: 提出的方法在计算词语语音相似度和分析语言语音结构方面是有效且可行的，具有良好的扩展性，可以轻松扩展到其他语言

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出InSide模型，通过图神经网络联合建模新闻语义和意图信号，在四个基准数据集上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测方法主要依赖语义线索（如情感词、文体特征），但这些表面模式容易在动态环境中失效。本文从新闻意图的新视角出发，认为结合意图可以更深入理解新闻欺骗的内在思想

Method: 提出基于图的意图-语义联合建模（InSide）方法：1）将语义和意图信号重构为异构图结构；2）通过实体引导实现长距离上下文交互；3）采用粗到细的意图建模；4）开发动态路径图对齐策略实现信号间的有效消息传递

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了InSide方法的优越性，相比最先进方法表现更好

Conclusion: 通过联合建模新闻语义和意图信号，能够更有效地检测假新闻，解决了仅依赖语义线索的局限性

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Abdelkrime Aries*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了chDzDT，一个针对阿尔及利亚方言形态特征的字符级预训练语言模型，解决了该方言因复杂形态、语码转换和多脚本特性导致的处理难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔及利亚方言在自然语言处理中代表性不足，其复杂的形态特征、频繁的语码转换、多脚本使用以及来自其他语言的强烈词汇影响，使得传统的词级或子词级方法效果有限。

Method: 开发字符级预训练语言模型chDzDT，基于孤立单词进行训练，不依赖分词边界或标准化拼写。训练语料来自YouTube评论、法语/英语/柏柏尔语维基百科和Tatoeba项目，涵盖多脚本和语言变体。

Result: 构建了阿尔及利亚方言的详细形态分析、多语言词典数据集，并开发了作为形态编码器的字符级PLM，在低资源方言处理方面展现出潜力。

Conclusion: 字符级建模为形态丰富、资源稀缺的方言提供了有效解决方案，为构建更具包容性和适应性的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLM的提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的人为产物而非模型固有缺陷，使用LLM作为评判者能显著降低性能方差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视广泛报道的LLM提示词敏感性，探究这是否是模型固有弱点还是评估过程的人为产物

Method: 系统评估7个LLM模型在6个基准测试上的表现，使用12个不同提示模板，比较启发式评估方法和LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法

Result: 发现提示词敏感性主要源于启发式评估方法，使用LLM评判者后性能方差大幅降低，模型排名相关性显著提高

Conclusion: 现代LLM对提示模板的鲁棒性比之前认为的更强，提示词敏感性更多是评估方法而非模型缺陷

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的大语言模型发展，AI面试官能够实时进行语音调查，需要评估这种新技术在定量和定性研究中的数据收集适用性。

Method: 通过回顾新兴证据，从输入/输出性能（语音识别、答案记录、情感处理）和语言推理能力（追问、澄清、分支逻辑处理）两个维度评估AI面试官和传统IVR系统。

Result: 实地研究表明AI面试官在定量和定性数据收集中已超越IVR系统，但存在实时转录错误率较高、情感检测能力有限、追问质量不均等问题。

Conclusion: 当前AI面试官技术的实用性、使用和采纳可能取决于具体的研究背景，特别是在定性数据收集中需要根据场景选择合适的技术方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)数据复杂且非结构化，传统机器学习方法难以有效提取关键患者信息，临床医生难以有效利用这些工具进行患者护理。

Method: 利用大型语言模型(LLMs)将OPQRST评估提取任务从序列标注重构为文本生成，使模型能够提供类似医生认知过程的推理步骤，并提出改进的命名实体识别评估指标，整合BERT Score等语义相似度度量。

Result: 该方法显著提升了AI在医疗保健中的应用，提供了可扩展的解决方案，提高了从EHRs中提取信息的准确性和可用性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于临床医生做出更明智的决策，改善患者护理结果，是医疗信息提取领域的重要进展。

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗主诉记录存在多种录入方式，导致医学术语标准化困难，难以在不同医疗机构间进行统一记录和文本挖掘。

Method: 采用分割匹配算法在120万条真实主诉记录上生成弱标注（实体提及和类别标签），然后训练基于BERT的模型进行实体识别和本体链接。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在没有人工标注的情况下，性能优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 弱监督实体提取和链接方法能够有效解决医疗主诉标准化问题，为医疗文本挖掘提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 争议解决在各个领域普遍存在，传统方式依赖人类法官处理。研究旨在利用LLMs辅助法官提高争议解决效率，特别是在汽车保险和域名争议等特定领域。

Method: 开发DRAssist系统，首先识别争议的关键结构元素并生成结构化摘要，然后使用多种提示策略让LLMs在三个层次上输出争议解决结果：识别优势方、评估具体诉求、分析论据强度。

Result: 通过比较LLMs与相关基线模型，使用合适的评估指标来评估模型在所有任务上的性能表现。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为有效的争议解决助手，DRAssist系统展示了在结构化争议分析和多层级决策方面的应用潜力。

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然擅长捕捉token级交互，但往往忽略层次结构模式，在细微语义区分方面存在困难。需要同时理解结构关系和细粒度语义区别。

Method: 1) 双图编码器：通过依存解析和主题建模构建语义图，使用图同构网络传播结构特征；2) 分层对比目标：在多个粒度上强制执行一致性，包括节点级对比正则化和图感知对比学习。

Result: 在三个法律文档匹配基准和学术抄袭检测数据集上表现显著优于最先进方法，在法律法规匹配上达到86.7% F1分数（绝对提升6.2%）。

Conclusion: StructCoh通过结合结构推理和对比学习，有效解决了文本语义匹配中的结构模式和语义区分问题，在复杂文档匹配任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域具有变革潜力，但其解释纵向患者叙述的能力尚未充分探索。牙科拥有丰富的结构化临床数据，为评估LLM推理能力提供了独特机会。

Method: 使用34个标准化纵向牙周病例（包含258个问答对），通过开放式临床任务评估GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash、Copilot和DeepSeek V3四种模型的表现，采用自动化指标和执业牙医盲法评估。

Result: DeepSeek表现最佳，显示出更高的忠实度（中位数得分0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457）和专家评分（中位数4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5），且未显著影响可读性。

Conclusion: DeepSeek是病例分析的领先LLM，支持其作为辅助工具整合到医学教育和研究中，并突显其作为领域特定代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

TL;DR: Genetic Prompt是一个结合遗传算法和LLM的框架，通过模拟基因交叉和变异操作来增强合成数据的质量和多样性，在多个NLP任务中显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成合成数据时质量和多样性不足的问题，使合成数据分布更接近真实世界数据。

Method: 将语义文本属性视为基因序列，利用LLM模拟交叉和变异操作，并集成主动学习方案来优化父代选择。

Result: 在多个NLP任务中显著优于最先进的基线方法，在不同规模的生成模型上都表现出鲁棒性能，与原始训练集融合后显著提升下游模型性能，特别是在类别不平衡场景中。

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt是生产高质量合成数据的有效方法，适用于广泛的NLP应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

TL;DR: 指令微调显著提升大语言模型在英语和意大利语中的长度控制能力，主要通过深层网络组件的专门化实现，不同语言采用不同的补偿机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在精确字数控制文本生成方面的挑战，比较基础模型和指令微调模型在英语和意大利语中的表现差异。

Method: 使用累积加权归因（源自直接对数归因）分析模型性能和内部组件贡献，研究不同层级的注意力头和MLP在长度控制中的作用。

Result: 指令微调大幅改善长度控制能力，英语中深层注意力头贡献显著增加，意大利语中最终层MLP发挥更强补偿作用。

Conclusion: 指令微调通过重新配置深层网络组件来实现任务遵从，组件级策略可能根据语言上下文进行适应性调整。

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

TL;DR: CRPO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过对比推理和检索增强的方式，利用LLMs的推理能力从对比示例中学习，显著提升了提示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法主要关注直接提示精炼或模型微调，忽视了利用LLMs固有推理能力从对比示例中学习的潜力。

Method: 提出对比推理提示优化(CRPO)框架，从HelpSteer2数据集中检索参考提示，构建两种优化范式：分层对比推理和多指标对比推理，通过显式对比高质量和低质量示例来优化提示。

Result: 在HelpSteer2基准测试中，CRPO显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 对比性、检索增强的推理方法在推进自动提示优化方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估范式存在与目标交互有限、难度控制不足、评估结果有效性验证困难等问题，难以精确确定目标模型的知识和能力边界。

Method: 采用知识驱动的数据合成和目标自适应难度调整方法，通过基准评分、交互扩展和评估反馈三个步骤进行扩展测试。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了JudgeAgent及其动态评估范式的有效性，提供了准确有效的评估结果。

Conclusion: JudgeAgent框架能够更精确地评估LLM的能力边界，为LLM在不同领域的成功应用提供了更好的评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了共模态RAG（CMRAG）方法，通过同时利用文本和图像信息来解决多模态文档问答任务中的检索增强生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多模态文档时存在局限：基于布局分析和文本提取的方法只能利用显式文本信息，难以处理图像和非结构化内容；而基于视觉语言模型的方法忽略了文本的语义优势，导致生成结果不理想。

Method: 首先对文档进行结构化解析，获得文本片段和图像区域的共模态表示；然后分别从文本和图像通道检索候选证据，并在跨模态检索层面聚合结果；最后提示视觉语言模型基于共模态检索结果生成最终响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉文档问答任务中显著优于纯视觉基础的RAG方法。

Conclusion: 将共模态信息以统一方式整合到RAG框架中是提高复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

TL;DR: 提出了AMBEDKAR框架，通过宪法感知解码层和推测解码算法，在不修改基础模型参数的情况下，有效减少印度语境中的种姓和宗教偏见，偏见绝对减少达26.41%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能无意中反映训练数据中的社会偏见，特别是在印度语境中，种姓和宗教偏见尤为突出。现有缓解策略多为西方中心，无法解决本地化细微差别。

Method: 引入宪法感知解码层，基于印度AI宪法指导，仅在推理时应用。采用推测解码算法，在生成过程中主动减少种姓和社群偏见。小型语言模型作为潜在偏见生成器，大型语言模型作为宪法指导的验证器。

Result: 与基线相比，偏见绝对减少高达26.41%。该方法无需重新训练，降低了计算和基础设施成本。

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR框架成功将推测解码重新诠释为公平性机制，而非仅仅是效率工具，为处理本地化社会偏见提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

TL;DR: 本文研究如何通过元学习提升小规模解码器语言模型在低资源语言命名实体识别任务中的零样本迁移能力，特别是在内存和延迟受限的环境下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言NER任务通常需要微调大型多语言模型，但在内存和延迟受限的环境中不可行。研究小规模解码器LM是否可以通过预训练实现快速适应并零样本迁移到未见过的语言。

Method: 使用一阶模型无关元学习（MAML）替换部分自回归目标进行预训练，在Tagalog和Cebuano语言上进行测试，这两种语言类型相似但在语法结构上存在差异。

Result: 在四种模型规模（11M-570M）下，MAML使零样本micro-F1在仅头层调优时提升2-6个百分点，全模型调优后提升1-3个百分点，同时收敛时间减少高达8%。对与Tagalog格助词si/ni共现的单标记人名实体提升最大。

Conclusion: MAML预训练能有效提升小模型在低资源语言NER任务中的零样本迁移性能，表面锚点（如格助词）对实体识别具有重要作用。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

TL;DR: 提出Avoidance Decoding解码策略，通过惩罚与先前生成内容的相似性来增强LLM生成故事的多样性，减少重复性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在相同输入提示下往往生成重复单调的输出，特别是在故事生成任务中缺乏创意多样性

Method: 通过修改token logits，自适应地平衡概念级相似性惩罚（早期阶段优先）和叙事级相似性惩罚（后期阶段加强），鼓励多样化多分支故事生成

Result: 相比强基线方法，输出多样性提高2.6倍，重复性平均减少30%，有效缓解文本退化问题，并激活更广泛的神经元

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了LLM生成内容的多样性，证明了能够有效利用模型内在创造力，为文本生成任务提供了有效的解码策略

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Conclusion: FActBench为医学领域提供了有效的事实核查基准，一致投票方法能够可靠地评估LLM的事实准确性，有助于缓解专业领域的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks
and six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Medical domain.
We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques
correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型的幻觉、偏见、隐私和高计算成本等问题，这些问题的根源在于单一模型同时承担语言能力和事实记忆功能

Method: 评估135M到32B参数规模的模型在三个维度上的表现：语言能力、外部事实知识、内部事实知识，分析规模扩展对不同能力的影响

Result: 发现语言能力和事实知识都随规模增长而提升，但内部事实知识增长更快，表明模型规模与记忆能力关联更紧密而非核心语言能力

Conclusion: 支持模块化语言建模方法，使用紧凑的语言能力强的模型作为工具增强系统的基础，FLM范式为更高效、可解释和可持续的NLP解决方案提供路径

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够不仅推断人类思维模式，还能揭示团队对话中的盲点，特别是团队成员在共同理解上的差异

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用LLM对任务导向对话进行共享心智模型元素标注；第二阶段使用另一个LLM比较LLM标注与人工标注的差异，检测分歧特征

Result: 创建了包含人工和LLM标注的数据集，建立了可复现的SMM一致性评估框架，发现LLM在简单自然语言标注任务中表现良好，但在需要空间推理或韵律线索消歧的场景中系统性地出错

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在自然语言标注任务中显示出明显的一致性，但在复杂推理场景中存在局限性，需要进一步改进以更好地支持团队协作分析

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO存在零梯度问题，主要由于固定裁剪边界和相同奖励标准化导致梯度更新无效和生成响应利用不足

Method: DCPO引入基于token特定先验概率动态调整裁剪边界的策略来增强token级探索，以及跨累积训练步骤标准化奖励的平滑优势标准化技术

Result: 在四个基准测试中实现SOTA性能，AIME24上Avg@1达46.7，Avg@32达38.8；非零优势比GRPO平均提升28%，训练效率比DAPO翻倍，token裁剪率显著降低一个数量级

Conclusion: DCPO能更有效地利用生成数据进行大语言模型的强化学习，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Conclusion: 该综述填补了LLMs隐式推理机制层面研究的空白，通过执行范式的分类方法为后续研究提供了结构化框架，有助于推动隐式推理技术的发展和应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交远程医疗产生了大量阿拉伯医疗文本数据，需要有效的疾病分类方法来利用这些数据。虽然大语言模型和transformer模型在医疗文本处理上表现强劲，但在阿拉伯医疗文本分类方面仍有提升空间。

Method: 采用三种阿拉伯医疗文本预处理方法：摘要、精炼和命名实体识别（NER），然后对精调的阿拉伯transformer模型（CAMeLBERT、AraBERT、AsafayaBERT）进行分类。采用多数投票集成学习策略，结合原始文本和预处理文本表征的预测结果。

Result: 该方法在阿拉伯社交远程医疗数据上达到了80.56%的最高分类准确率，显示了其在利用多种文本表征和模型预测方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首次将LLM基于预处理与精调阿拉伯transformer模型和集成学习相结合的研究，为阿拉伯社交远程医疗数据的疾病分类提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了医疗文本理解能力。

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoPerso是一个自监督框架，通过情感感知建模改进人格检测，利用生成机制进行数据增强和表示学习，通过多任务学习和跨注意力模块捕捉人格与情感的细粒度交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模标注数据集且难以获得高质量人格标签，同时忽视了情感与人格之间的相互作用关系。

Method: 提出EmoPerso框架：1）利用生成机制进行合成数据增强和丰富表示学习；2）提取伪标签情感特征并通过多任务学习与人格预测联合优化；3）使用跨注意力模块捕捉人格特质与情感表示的细粒度交互；4）采用自学习策略迭代增强模型推理能力。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，EmoPerso超越了最先进的模型。

Conclusion: EmoPerso通过情感感知建模有效提升了人格检测性能，证明了情感与人格相互作用的重要性，并提供了可复现的源代码。

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在处理任务时并不总是整合外部标签定义，而是经常依赖内部参数化知识，特别是在通用任务中；领域特定任务能更多受益于显式定义


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正整合外部定义还是主要依赖其参数化知识，以及不同定义条件对模型性能的影响

Method: 在多个解释基准数据集（通用和领域特定）上进行受控实验，使用专家策划、LLM生成、扰动和交换的定义条件

Result: 显式标签定义能提高准确性和可解释性，但LLMs整合外部知识的过程既不保证也不一致，模型经常默认使用内部表示

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解LLMs如何处理外部知识与现有能力的关系，特别是在不同任务类型中的差异表现

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

*Ahmed Ahmed,Kevin Klyman,Yi Zeng,Sanmi Koyejo,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自动化框架来审计基础模型是否遵守其开发者发布的行为准则，发现主要AI公司的模型存在系统性不一致和合规差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型开发者发布了行为准则承诺，但缺乏系统性的审计来验证模型是否真正遵守这些规范，需要建立评估框架

Method: 开发自动化审计框架，通过解析行为声明、生成针对性提示、使用模型作为评判者来评估三方面一致性（提供商规范、模型输出、模型评判）

Result: 对6个开发者的16个模型进行了超过100条行为声明的测试，发现系统性不一致，提供商之间的合规差距高达20%

Conclusion: 基础模型在遵守开发者行为规范方面存在显著差距，需要建立更严格的审计机制来确保模型行为与承诺一致

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

TL;DR: 提出GRAM-R²生成式奖励模型，通过自训练方法利用未标注数据激发奖励推理能力，在多项任务中表现优于现有基准模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型严重依赖大规模标注偏好数据，而预训练方法缺乏明确的推理能力，需要开发能够进行奖励推理的通用奖励模型

Method: 采用自训练方法利用未标注数据激发奖励推理，开发GRAM-R²生成式奖励模型，不仅能产生偏好标签还能生成奖励理由

Result: 在响应排序、任务适应和人类反馈强化学习等实验中，GRAM-R² consistently outperforms several strong discriminative and generative baselines

Conclusion: GRAM-R²可作为奖励推理的基础模型，支持下游应用如响应排序和任务特定奖励调优，在广泛任务中表现优异

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了对滥用的担忧，现有方法忽视风格建模且依赖静态阈值，限制了检测性能

Method: MoSEs包含三个核心组件：风格参考库(SRR)、风格感知路由器(SAR)和条件阈值估计器(CTE)，通过动态确定最优阈值进行检测

Result: 相比基线方法平均提升11.34%的检测性能，在低资源情况下提升更显著达39.15%

Conclusion: MoSEs框架通过风格感知的不确定性量化有效提升了AI生成文本检测的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源印度语言中语义评估的挑战，由于缺乏高质量基准数据集，句子转换器在这些语言中的效果尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建包含10种印度语言和英语的新闻文章数据集，每篇文章配有4种头条变体（原始、语义相似、词汇相似、不相关），使用余弦相似度评估多种句子转换器模型。

Result: 多语言模型表现一致良好，而特定语言模型的效果存在差异，证明了该数据集在评估语义理解能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该数据集不仅为印度NLP提供了重要基准资源，还可用于RAG管道评估、多选题问答、头条分类等多种应用，具有广泛的实用价值。

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared
publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过AI技术重现了1929年Federico Pucci发明的基于规则的机械翻译系统，验证了其方法在94年后的有效性，并将这一被遗忘的早期机器翻译先驱重新纳入历史视野。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新发掘和验证Federico Pucci在1929年提出的基于规则的机械翻译系统，这一早期发明几乎被完全遗忘且从未在实际中应用，旨在确认其作为机器翻译领域先驱的历史地位。

Method: 使用AI按照Pucci的方法重新翻译1931年文献中记载的两个文本片段：但丁《新生》的意法翻译和伏尔泰《查第格》的法意翻译，然后扩展到英语、西班牙语和德语，并尝试翻译更现代的科技文本。

Result: AI按照Pucci方法翻译的结果与94年前的原始翻译相比差异很小，验证了该系统的有效性。系统成功扩展到其他语言并处理现代文本，证明了其跨语言和跨时代的适用性。

Conclusion: Pucci的机械翻译系统经过AI验证确实有效，应被确认为机器翻译领域的早期先驱，与Troyanskij、Booth和Weaver等人并列，这可能会重新书写机器翻译的历史发展脉络。

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

*Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo,Seyedarmin Azizi,Souvik Kundu,Massoud Pedram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出top-H解码方法，通过熵约束质量最大化理论框架，在保持逻辑连贯性的同时显著提升文本生成的多样性和创造力，相比现有方法性能提升达25.63%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有截断采样方法（如温度缩放、top-p采样、min-p采样）在平衡文本生成的多样性和逻辑连贯性方面存在局限，特别是未能有效利用模型的置信度信息。min-p采样仅依赖单个top token作为置信度启发式，未能充分利用概率分布信息。

Method: 首先建立熵约束最小散度问题的理论框架，证明其等价于NP难的熵约束质量最大化（ECMM）问题，然后提出top-H解码这一计算高效贪心算法来解决ECMM问题。

Result: 在创意写作基准测试中，top-H比最先进的min-p采样方法性能提升高达25.63%，在GPQA、GSM8K和MT-Bench等问答数据集上保持鲁棒性。LLM作为评估者的实验证实top-H即使在更高温度下也能产生连贯输出。

Conclusion: top-H解码推动了开放文本生成的最新技术发展，能够轻松集成到创意写作应用中，在保持连贯性的同时显著提升生成文本的创造力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印地语-英语混合文本的命名实体识别面临非正式结构、音译和频繁语言切换等独特挑战，需要评估不同模型在此任务上的有效性。

Method: 评估了HingBERT、HingMBERT、HingRoBERTa等代码混合微调模型，BERT Base Cased、IndicBERT、RoBERTa、MuRIL等多语言模型，以及Google Gemini零样本模型，使用精确率、召回率和F1分数进行性能测试。

Result: 代码混合模型（特别是HingRoBERTa和HingBERT）表现最佳，超越了包括Google Gemini在内的闭源大语言模型。非代码混合模型表现尚可但适应性有限。Google Gemini在零样本设置下展现出有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 专门针对代码混合数据进行预训练的模型在印地语-英语混合命名实体识别任务上表现最优，但现代大语言模型也显示出强大的泛化能力，为代码混合NER任务提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在奖励信号稀疏和策略梯度更新不稳定的问题，特别是在基于RL的方法中

Method: 将结果奖励视为可预测标签，将RLVR问题重新表述为对策略模型参数化评分函数的监督学习任务，使用交叉熵损失进行优化

Result: 在数学推理任务上超越PPO和GRPO等强基线，在AIME 2025上达到59.78%的pass@256，比PPO和GRPO分别提升13.32和14.36个百分点

Conclusion: PACS提供了一个简单而强大的框架，为具有可验证奖励的LLM后训练提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Motivation: 挑战传统认为多语ASR模型通过利用跨语言语音相似性优于单语模型的假设，证明对于足够小的模型，精心设计的单语训练可以取得更好性能，为代表性不足语言提供准确的设备端ASR支持。

Method: 使用27M参数的单语模型，在精心平衡的高质量人工标注、伪标注和合成数据混合上进行训练，专门针对阿拉伯语、中文、日语、韩语、乌克兰语和越南语等语言。

Result: 平均错误率比同等大小的Whisper Tiny模型降低48%，性能优于大9倍的Whisper Small模型，在大多数情况下匹配或优于大28倍的Whisper Medium模型。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了该规模模型的技术水平，为之前支持有限的语言实现了准确的设备端ASR，并将这些模型以宽松的开源许可证发布。

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

TL;DR: DARLING框架通过强化学习同时优化响应质量和语义多样性，解决大语言模型后训练中多样性不足的问题，在创意任务和数学竞赛任务中均取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型后训练往往只关注准确性和有用性，导致输出分布变窄、多样性降低，限制了模型在创意探索任务（如头脑风暴、故事创作、问题解决）中的实用性。

Method: 提出多样性感知强化学习（DARLING）框架，引入学习的划分函数来测量超越表面词汇变化的语义多样性，将多样性信号与质量奖励结合进行在线强化学习。

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模上的实验显示，DARLING在非可验证任务（指令遵循和创意写作）和可验证任务（数学竞赛）中均优于仅优化质量的基线方法，产生更高质量和更新颖的输出，并提高了pass@1和pass@k指标。

Conclusion: 明确优化多样性能够催化在线强化学习中的探索，表现为更高质量的响应，证明质量与多样性可以协同优化而非相互冲突。

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and

in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

*Fakhraddin Alwajih,Abdellah El Mekki,Hamdy Mubarak,Majd Hawasly,Abubakr Mohamed,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PalmX 2025是首个评估大语言模型在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域能力的共享任务，包含阿拉伯文化和伊斯兰文化两个子任务，通过多选题测试模型的文化理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型主要基于西方高资源语言数据训练，对阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化的理解存在明显不足，特别是对代表性不足的主题。

Method: 设计了两个多选题子任务（通用阿拉伯文化和通用伊斯兰文化），涵盖22个阿拉伯国家的传统、食物、历史、宗教实践和语言表达等主题。

Result: 任务吸引了26个团队注册，最终收到9个和6个有效提交。任务特定微调显著提升性能，最佳系统在文化问题上达到72.15%准确率，伊斯兰知识达到84.22%。参数高效微调是最主流有效的方法。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化理解方面存在明显差距，但通过任务特定微调可以显著改善性能，参数高效微调是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上取得优越性能，同时显著降低模型复杂度

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署问题，验证了其有效性和灵活性

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Conclusion: MESTI作为优秀输入模态和MEGANet作为先进识别网络的组合为微表情识别系统在各种应用中提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

Conclusion: 离散扩散为3D稀疏体素生成建模提供了一个有前景的框架，即使在极高稀疏度数据上也能有效工作

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾模型在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，通常需要降采样或分块处理导致性能下降，主要原因是难以有效结合全局上下文信息和局部精细细节

Method: SGLC框架包含两个主要组件：全局特征生成器(GFG)产生初步去雾结果，局部特征增强器(LFE)细化局部细节和像素级特征，可集成到现有去雾模型中

Result: 在高分辨率数据集上实验显示PSNR显著提升，证明SGLC能有效处理大规模图像中的雾霾问题

Conclusion: SGLC是模型无关的框架，能够增强任何去雾网络的全局-局部特征融合能力，显著提高高分辨率环境下的视觉保真度

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了首个大规模自监督异常检测模型，用于肾脏毒理学病理学检测，通过自监督方法在UNI基础模型特征上实现了优于随机猜测的性能，可用于药物安全评估中排除正常切片。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏异常检测在临床前药物开发中至关重要，但传统方法需要检查数百到数千张全切片图像，过程耗时且成本高昂，大多数图像都是正常的，需要检测指示毒性效应的细微变化。

Method: 使用来自158种化合物的药物安全评估研究数据，探索基于UNI基础模型提取的特征进行肾脏异常检测的复杂性。首先使用简单的k近邻分类器，然后应用自监督方法处理相同特征。

Result: k近邻分类器在UNI基础模型特征上的表现接近随机猜测，表明仅靠FM生成的特征不足以检测异常。而自监督方法实现了优于随机猜测的性能，ROC曲线下面积为0.62，阴性预测值达到89%。

Conclusion: 通过进一步开发，这种模型可用于药物安全评估研究中排除正常切片，从而降低药物开发相关成本和时间。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在文本和图像表示空间存在模态鸿沟，限制了文本到图像检索的性能，需要弥合这种差距

Method: 两阶段方法：1）使用扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询；2）通过视觉模型估计图像相似度。还引入聚合网络融合多生成图像和跨模态相似度分数

Result: 广泛评估表明，该方法在文本到图像检索任务上始终优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉编码器、VLM和文本到图像生成模型的进展，成功弥合了模态鸿沟，提升了检索性能

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时经常推断并泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别、年龄等），即使这些信息没有被明确要求，这在现实应用和社会敏感领域存在严重隐私风险

Method: 1) 创建PRISM基准来评估模型在两个方面的表现：拒绝生物特征相关查询和在一般响应中避免隐含生物特征泄露；2) 对LLaVA数据集进行详细审计；3) 构建Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性地移除显性和隐性生物特征信息

Result: 评估显示不同MLLM模型存在各种属性的生物特征泄露问题；在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调的模型显著减少了生物特征泄露

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM为隐私对齐的多模态大语言模型开发和评估设立了新标准，提供了公开可用的数据集和基准

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，VEME方法显著提升了动态环境中的推理和规划能力，为具身智能的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To

with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

TL;DR: 本文提出了FHT2SP算法，一种快速且高精度的霍夫变换算法，在保持常数有界误差的同时实现近最优计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有快速霍夫变换算法要么计算复杂度高但精度有限，要么精度高但计算成本接近立方级，需要一种兼顾计算效率和精度的解决方案

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，扩展到任意形状（超越原始幂次方约束），并将其集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过超像素大小选择控制精度

Result: FHT2SP算法实现近最优计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持与图像大小无关的常数有界近似误差，可通过元参数控制

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法成功解决了霍夫变换中计算复杂度与精度之间的权衡问题，为各种应用提供了高效且准确的解决方案

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语言引导的生成式视觉系统，用于制造业残留轮廓检测，通过条件GAN和视觉语言建模实现CAD级精度，在工业数据集上显著提升了轮廓保真度和几何对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统常受噪声、材料变异和不受控成像条件影响，传统边缘检测器和手工流程效果有限，需要更精确的解决方案。

Method: 三阶段系统：数据采集预处理、条件GAN轮廓生成、视觉语言模型多模态轮廓细化，采用人机协作的标准提示词和图像-文本引导合成。

Conclusion: VLM引导的生成式工作流程有望推动工业计算机视觉超越传统管道的限制，展示了语言引导方法在精密制造应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LIMO的新方法，通过信息论和参数高效微调技术，在transductive few-shot CLIP任务中取得了显著性能提升，大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前transductive few-shot学习主要集中在视觉模型，而基于基础视觉-语言模型(VLMs)的研究仍处于早期阶段。现有方法较少，需要专门为VLM设计的transductive方法。

Method: 提出了语言感知信息最大化(LIMO)损失函数，包含三个互补项：视觉输入与文本类别描述的互信息、KL散度惩罚项（防止网络输出偏离文本驱动的零样本预测）、以及基于标注样本的标准交叉熵损失。同时探索了参数高效微调(PEFT)策略。

Result: LIMO方法大幅超越近期transductive few-shot CLIP方法，相比最佳inductive方法也有显著提升。参数高效微调策略带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在transductive few-shot设置中调整模型参数子集的潜力，为VLM的transductive学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

TL;DR: MorphGen是一种通过显式建模核形态和空间组织来提高组织病理学图像域泛化能力的方法，使用监督对比学习框架整合图像、增强和核分割掩码，在域外泛化和对抗攻击方面表现出色。

Motivation: 组织病理学全切片图像存在机构间差异（组织制备、染色、成像条件），而病理学家依赖域不变的形态学特征进行诊断。受此启发，研究旨在学习对域偏移具有弹性的癌症表征。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法：在监督对比学习框架中整合组织病理学图像、数据增强和核分割掩码，通过对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表征来优先考虑诊断特征；加入随机权重平均(SWA)增强域外鲁棒性。

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类；学习到的表征对图像损坏（染色伪影）和对抗攻击具有弹性，展示了优秀的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: MorphGen通过显式建模生物学稳健的核形态和空间组织，成功学习了具有域偏移弹性的癌症表征，不仅提高了域外泛化性能，还解决了数字病理学深度学习系统的关键脆弱性问题。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token剪枝方法存在校准成本高、重要性度量次优的问题，导致保留冗余token。视觉token和文本token的冗余特性不同，需要专门针对视觉token的剪枝方法

Method: 提出基于互信息的token剪枝策略，移除与文本token语义不对齐的视觉token；同时通过最大化嵌入空间中的期望成对距离来剪枝冗余视觉token，使用贪心算法高效求解

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上，实现了88.9%的token减少，推理速度提升56.7%，同时保持了强性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态模型中视觉token冗余问题，在显著减少计算和内存成本的同时保持了模型性能，为高效多模态推理提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Conclusion: 通过大量实验验证了方法的优越性、可靠性和稳定性，为实时图像融合提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Motivation: 现有单域泛化方法忽视了目标部署环境的文本描述这个可用资源，而文本媒体数据在实际应用中很容易获得。

Method: 提出STAR模块：1)从目标文本描述提取子空间来重定位图像特征；2)使用谱投影保留与目标线索对齐的方向；3)通过视觉-语言矩阵矩阵远离对齐背榜特征；4)使用特征空间Mixup确保源和目标表示之间的平滑迁移。

Result: 在多个图像分类和物体检测标准数据集上的实验表明STAR方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 最小化的文本媒体数据能够在严重数据限制条件下显著提升模型泛化能力，为在未见数据的目标环境中部署健壮模型开启了新途径。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Nepal demonstrate that AQFusionNet consistently outperforms unimodal baselines,
achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the
EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over
single-modality approaches while maintaining low computational overhead, making
it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and
practical solution for AQI monitoring in infrastructure-limited environments,
offering robust predictive capability even under partial sensor availability.

<details>

Motivation: 高光谱图像去噪是重要预处理步骤，干净HSI通常存在于低维子空间，但如何充分使用这种物理特性进行有效去噪同时保持图像细节具有挑战性

Method: 在U-Net架构中嵌入秩最小化模块(RMM)，将特征图转换到小波域并对低频分量应用奇异值阈值处理(SVT)，自适应学习参数，采用迭代细化过程自适应结合中间去噪结果和噪声输入

Conclusion: ILRNet通过整合模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优势，有效利用了高光谱图像的物理先验，实现了优异的去噪性能和细节保持能力

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Abstract: We describe a publicly available multimodal dataset of annotated Positron
Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies for head and neck
cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients
with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10
international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered
PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical
diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved
lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists
and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control
measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with
expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a
subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes
TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up
outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We
demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks:
automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV
status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep
learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic
frameworks.

*Guangzong Si,Hao Yin,Xianfei Li,Qing Ding,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉潜在场校准(VPFC)方法，通过区分遗漏和虚构幻觉的不同成因，有效减少多模态大语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，而不引发新的虚构幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法错误地假设遗漏和虚构幻觉有共同成因，往往在减少遗漏的同时引发更多虚构。本文发现遗漏幻觉源于视觉特征映射到语言表达时信心不足，而虚构幻觉来自训练语料统计偏差导致的跨模态表示空间伪关联。

Method: 基于视觉注意力干预实验发现，提出视觉-语义注意力潜在场的概念框架，揭示模型如何构建视觉证据推断物体存在与否。在此基础上开发了即插即用的VPFC方法。

Result: VPFC方法有效减少了遗漏幻觉，同时没有引入额外的虚构幻觉，为幻觉缓解策略提供了新的方向。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前物体幻觉研究的关键疏忽，为开发更鲁棒和平衡的幻觉缓解策略指明了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个针对视觉语言模型的两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化来增强模型鲁棒性，同时保持视觉理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活引导的防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能次优且可能降低视觉定位能力，需要更有效的防御方案

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段计算自适应层特定引导向量来抑制有害行为；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化过程细化引导向量，整合自动毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励

Result: SPO-VLM通过激活引导和偏好优化显著增强了对攻击的安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强劲性能且不损害视觉理解能力

Conclusion: SPO-VLM的两阶段结构在效率和效果之间取得了平衡，为VLM提供了有效的对抗攻击防御方案，代码和模型权重将开源以支持复现和未来研究

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于点云数据稀缺，预训练大型3D模型困难，现有方法通过"高到低"映射会丢失空间几何信息，且缺乏通用框架将任意模态适配到3D领域

Method: 将原始点云转换为点嵌入以捕获空间特征，使用排列不变特征处理点云无序性，通过共享权重的提示生成器动态产生点提示，与冻结预训练模型拼接

Result: 该方法能够直接处理点云数据，保持空间几何信息，减少计算开销，并为异构数据提供丰富的全局结构信息

Conclusion: APPT方法为将任意模态的基础模型校准到3D点云分析提供了有效的参数高效微调解决方案

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CutMix等方法在组合多个类别的图像时，由于上下文差异会产生不自然的边界，需要一种能够生成自然融合图像的数据增强方法

Method: 在扩散模型中部分融合两个不同类别对应的估计噪声，利用扩散模型生成自然高分辨率图像的能力和CutMix融合特征的特点

Result: 在分类实验中验证了该方法的有效性，相比传统多类别组合数据增强技术和随机图像生成方法表现更好

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix方法能够有效生成自然的高分辨率融合图像，为数据增强提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Motivation: 传统3D LiDAR点云分割需要大量标注数据，成本高且耗时，而现实世界图像数据集丰富易得。为减轻3D点云标注负担，利用自动驾驶中多模态传感器同步数据的优势进行跨模态知识迁移

Method: 使用预训练2D图像模型处理未标注2D数据，通过已知2D-3D对应关系进行跨模态知识蒸馏，使3D网络输出与2D网络对应点对齐。采用自校准卷积作为域适应模块基础，保留模态通用信息，过滤模态特定细节

Conclusion: 提出的跨模态知识蒸馏方法成功解决了3D点云标注难题，利用2D图像模型的丰富知识实现了高质量的3D LiDAR语义分割，为自动驾驶感知系统提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统叙事分析需要将各种数据转化为手写叙事故事，给研究者和参与者带来巨大数据分析负担，需要更高效、参与者友好的叙事制作和呈现方法

Method: 开发NAME范式，包含演员定位和形状模块以促进合理图像生成，设计包含三个关键维度的评估指标来客观衡量生成角色的感知质量和叙事一致性

Result: 在不同数据划分方案下均表现最优，仅需0.96%数据即可将FID分数从195降至152；相同数据量下显著改进：70:30划分从175降至152，95:5划分从96降至49；新指标得分3.62超越基线2.66

Conclusion: NAME范式成功减轻了叙事分析中的认知负担，为叙事探究领域提供了更高效和参与者友好的方法，在数据效率和生成质量方面都取得了显著突破

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

Motivation: 自我中心视频中频繁和突然的视角变化导致物体外观显著变化和部分遮挡，现有方法难以实现精确定位，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出HERO-VQL方法，包含：1）Top-down Attention Guidance利用类别token提供高层上下文和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；2）EgoACT通过查询增强和帧重排序模拟极端视角变化，并使用一致性训练确保定位稳定性。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL能有效处理自我中心视频的挑战，性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL方法通过模拟人类认知过程，成功解决了自我中心视频中物体定位的难题，为这一领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建可减少患者辐射暴露和检查时间，但会导致噪声增加和成像细节减少，影响图像质量。需要一种灵活且高效的重建方法。

Method: DCDM包含核变换器约束(NTC)和编码连接约束(ENC)两个模块。NTC利用核范数近似矩阵秩最小化，将低秩特性整合到Transformer架构中，从低剂量图像提取压缩特征表示。ENC利用这些特征表示编码和控制预训练扩散模型，最终在像素空间获得重建PET图像。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)上优于最先进方法，在未知DRF场景下也具有良好的泛化能力，即使在超低剂量水平(如1%全剂量)下也很有价值。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，提高了重建灵活性，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数，在超低剂量PET重建中表现出色。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Motivation: 全景视频在VR和遥感等领域应用广泛，但其广角视野常导致不需要的物体出现在视频中。现有视频修复方法主要针对普通窄视野视频，无法处理全景视频等距柱状投影带来的畸变问题。

Method: 提出DAOVI模型，包含两个核心模块：1）基于测地距离评估图像空间时间运动信息的模块；2）特征空间中设计的深度感知特征传播模块，专门处理全景视频的几何畸变。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI模型成功解决了全景视频修复中的几何畸变问题，通过创新的测地距离运动评估和深度感知特征传播技术，实现了更好的修复效果。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Motivation: 现有方法在从单目视频重建人体化身时，要么难以捕捉输入中的细粒度动态细节，要么在新视角下生成合理的细节方面存在困难，主要源于化身模型的表示能力有限和观测数据不足。

Conclusion: 通过利用视频生成模型提供多视角监督信号，结合身份注入和补丁去噪策略，成功提升了人体化身重建的质量和细节表现能力。

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可加速现有视觉语言模型推理的方法，通过分层令牌合并和KV缓存压缩技术，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在推理过程中存在编码和解码阶段效率低下的问题，特别是处理长序列时延迟较高，需要一种无需重新训练的高效加速方法。

Method: 采用两阶段加速策略：编码阶段使用金字塔令牌合并技术分层减少不同LLM层的令牌数量；解码阶段通过KV缓存压缩移除不必要的缓存来提升网络吞吐量。

Result: 实验显示LightVLM在仅保留35%图像令牌时保持100%性能，3%令牌时保持98%性能，网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍，长序列推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM成功实现了对现有VLMs的无训练加速，使大型模型推理速度超过小模型，为实际部署提供了有效解决方案，在性能保持和速度提升方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

*Lubin Gan,Xiaoman Wu,Jing Zhang,Zhifeng Wang,Linhao Qu,Siying Wu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemaMIL是一种新的多实例学习方法，通过语义重排序和语义引导检索状态空间模块，在计算病理学中实现了最先进的准确率，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力机制MIL方法忽略了上下文关系，Transformer模型计算复杂度高且容易过拟合，状态空间模型虽然计算复杂度低但打乱补丁顺序会破坏组织学意义。

Method: 提出SemaMIL框架，包含语义重排序(SR)方法对语义相似的补丁进行聚类和排序，以及语义引导检索状态空间模块(SRSM)选择代表性查询子集来调整状态空间参数。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上的评估显示，SemaMIL相比强基线方法实现了最先进的准确率，同时使用了更少的FLOPs和参数。

Conclusion: SemaMIL成功解决了现有MIL方法的局限性，在保持组织学意义和可解释性的同时，实现了高效且准确的全局建模。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

*Bo Wu,Zhiqi Ai,Jun Jiang,Congcong Zhu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SA-LDL算法，通过阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数解决年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题，在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别达到1.74和2.15的MAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习建模相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽略了不同年龄阶段存在不同程度的标签模糊性。通过分析锚点与所有其他年龄的嵌入相似性，发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段性模式。

Method: 提出阶段自适应标签分布学习(SA-LDL)算法，联合使用阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特征。

Result: 在MORPH-II数据集上MAE为1.74，在FG-NET数据集上MAE为2.15，表现出有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: SA-LDL算法能够更准确和鲁棒地进行年龄估计，通过阶段自适应方法有效解决了标签模糊性问题。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

*Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Jinwei Zhang,Yuxi Zhang,Xinyao Yue,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR)框架，通过分离特征学习和光流估计，使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取和光流估计，在大变形模型下构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，实现了更好的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于学习的技术显著提高了可变形图像配准的精度和速度，但降低计算复杂度和处理大变形仍然是挑战。研究卷积神经网络在配准中的作用，发现其在局部强度线性化和全局对比度变化协调方面发挥关键作用。

Method: 提出EOIR框架，将特征学习与光流估计分离：使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，一组3层光流估计器构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，在大变形模型下逐步组合微分同胚变形。

Result: 在五个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证了EOIR的有效性，实现了优越的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡。在可比精度下，EOIR提供更好的效率和平滑度，反之亦然。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分析ConvNet在配准中的作用并分离特征学习与光流估计，成功解决了计算复杂度和处理大变形的问题，为图像配准提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

Motivation: 研究LLM在需要精确物理控制和空间推理的游戏环境中的决策能力，Jump-Jump游戏提供了简单但具有挑战性的测试场景。

Method: 使用Jump-Jump游戏作为测试平台，分析LLM在控制跳跃力度、空间距离判断和策略规划方面的表现。

### [180] [VideoRewardBench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal Reward Models for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00484)
*Zhihong Zhang,Xiaojian Huang,Jin Xu,Zhuodong Luo,Xinzhi Wang,Jiansheng Wei,Xuejin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型评估基准，涵盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个维度，包含1,563个标注样本，评估了28个模型，发现最佳模型准确率仅57%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面等问题，需要建立一个更全面的评估体系。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建高质量偏好数据集，包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组样本，评估三类多模态奖励模型：生成式、判别式和半标量式。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到57.0%准确率，开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%。研究发现：RL训练不一定带来更好的跨模态泛化；除判别式模型外，其他模型可从推理时缩放中受益；视频帧数变化对不同类型模型影响不同。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性并提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了STVH和M-STVH两种时空视频哈希方法，用于细粒度群体活动检索，能够同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，在公开数据集上取得优异效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂场景中视频数据的爆炸式增长，快速检索群体活动成为迫切需求。现有方法只能检索整个视频，无法实现活动粒度的检索。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕获群体视觉特征和位置特征的时空演化。M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习实现分层特征集成，能够同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能取得优异的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的STVH和M-STVH方法有效解决了细粒度群体活动检索问题，能够满足实际视频检索场景中对活动特征和对象视觉特征的不同需求。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST是一个针对超声图像的token驱动双流框架，通过分离内容和风格特征，选择最适合下游任务的目标风格token，提升跨设备图像转换性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同超声设备采集的图像存在风格差异，导致下游任务性能下降。现有无配对图像转换方法未能充分考虑下游任务需求，可能产生不合适的风格转换。

Method: 提出token驱动双流框架，包含数据视角选择合适目标token和模型视角选择最优目标token，并注入辅助提示来匹配内容表示与下游任务行为。

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有无配对图像转换方法。

Conclusion: TRUST框架通过token驱动的风格选择和内容保持机制，有效解决了跨设备超声图像风格转换问题，提升了下游任务的适应性。

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了黑盒蒸馏(B2D)设置和ATGC方法，利用注意力引导的动态尺度选择来解决开放词汇模型在不同分辨率下的性能差异问题，仅需one-hot预测即可实现有效的本地模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI即服务的普及使得预训练模型通过API提供，但无法获取模型权重、训练数据或logits，当前领域自适应方法在这种黑盒约束下不适用，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC)方法，利用DINOv2注意力图通过熵评分动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推理，识别信息丰富的尺度进行伪标签生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法在黑盒监督下在多个数据集上取得显著改进，仅需API的one-hot预测即可实现有效蒸馏。

Conclusion: ATGC方法成功解决了开放词汇模型在不同分辨率下的敏感性问题，为黑盒模型蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

TL;DR: 提出LBD框架解决类增量语义分割中的语义纠缠问题，利用视觉语言模型引导特征解耦，在Pascal VOC和ADE20k上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类增量语义分割存在灾难性语义纠缠问题，包括原型-特征纠缠和背景-增量纠缠，现有方法依赖视觉特征学习但缺乏足够线索来区分目标

Method: 使用语言引导的原型解耦和流形互背景解耦，利用CLIP的预训练语义作为拓扑模板，结合软提示调优和编码器适配

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上实现了最先进的性能，特别是在多步增量场景中表现优异

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，通过语言引导的特征解耦显著提升了增量学习性能

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

TL;DR: BrainFM是一个模态无关的多任务视觉基础模型，通过创新的"轻度到重度"生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，能够处理多种脑成像任务，包括图像合成、分割、距离估计、偏置场估计和配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（特别是MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向的差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出"轻度到重度"的受试者内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（如模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，BrainFM在所有任务和输入模态中都表现出强大的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM作为一个模态无关的基础模型，能够直接应用于多种脑成像基础任务，解决了现有方法在未校准模态中的泛化问题，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)方法，通过交叉注意力机制整合全局场景上下文与局部特征，在细粒度车辆损伤检测任务上超越现有最佳模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiffusionDet方法在上下文依赖场景中受限于局部特征条件，无法充分利用全局场景信息，导致在细粒度目标检测（如车辆损伤评估）中性能有限

Method: 引入Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)框架，使用独立的专用编码器生成全局上下文信息，通过交叉注意力机制让每个目标提议都能关注到全面的环境信息

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中显著超越现有最先进模型，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测建立了新的性能基准

Conclusion: CAF方法通过有效整合全局场景上下文，显著提升了生成式检测范式的性能，为解决上下文依赖的细粒度目标检测问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Method: 1) 全局-局部解耦模块：使用NLP技术将文本输入分解为局部类别名词和全局修饰语，通过无监督掩码提议网络将图像输入分割为类别无关的掩码提议；2) 局部尺度特征对齐：采用上下文感知裁剪策略提取图像块，并引入遥感特定知识丰富文本输入；3) 全局尺度对齐：提出跨尺度Grad-CAM模块利用全局修饰语的上下文信息优化Grad-CAM图，并通过掩码选择模块整合像素级激活到掩码级分割输出。

Result: 支持开放词汇语义分割(OVSS)和参考表达式分割(RES)，实现了准确且可解释的全局和局部维度对齐。

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架有效解决了视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的迁移挑战，通过解耦和对齐策略实现了无需训练的跨域分割能力。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Conclusion: 该方法简化了甲烷检测流程，降低了计算成本，为卫星上快速检测提供了可行方案，相关数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

Conclusion: MV-SSM框架通过状态空间建模有效解决了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化问题，在多种挑战性场景下表现出强大的性能，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

TL;DR: FtZ框架通过组合语义强大的锚定编码器和感知丰富的增强编码器，解决了MLLMs在细粒度视觉任务上的性能瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上表现不佳，主要原因是单一视觉编码器架构牺牲了细粒度视觉信息捕捉能力

Method: 提出FtZ视觉塔框架，通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚定编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器进行创新性组合

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线模型

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实世界基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从未标注真实数据学习的挑战。现有方法依赖合成数据或违反光度假设的自监督学习，存在域差距问题

Method: 引入选择-调优-保持(STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重。调优阶段自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向初始化，保持阶段基于稳定秩实施主方向正则化

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用恶劣天气合成数据训练的方法，甚至超过了深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略通过参数高效微调实现了恶劣天气下的泛化深度估计，在保持预训练模型泛化能力的同时实现了灵活的任务适应

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了视觉语言模型中批评者模型只用于评估而不用于生成的惯例，通过将偏好标签数据集重组为可验证训练信号，直接在基础生成模型上进行强化学习，开发出既能优化偏好判断又保持完整生成能力的统一模型LLaVA-Critic-R1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言建模中，批评者模型仅用于评估输出（分配标量分数或成对偏好），而策略模型负责生成响应，这种分离导致批评者很少被考虑直接用于策略目的。本研究旨在挑战这一惯例。

Method: 将偏好标记的批评者数据集重组为可验证训练信号，在基础生成模型上直接进行强化学习，开发出LLaVA-Critic-R1模型，该模型既能优化偏好判断又保持完整生成能力。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅成为顶级批评者模型，还作为竞争性策略模型，在26个视觉推理和理解基准测试中匹配或超越专门训练的推理VLM，平均比基础模型提升+5.7%。扩展方法到现有强推理VLM得到LLaVA-Critic-R1+，在7B规模上实现MMMU基准71.9的SOTA性能。测试时应用自我批评可在五个代表性推理任务上平均提升+13.8%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在批评者数据上进行RL训练可以产生一个在评估和生成方面都表现出色的统一模型，为可扩展、自我改进的多模态系统提供了一条简单路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以建模长距离空间-光谱特征依赖关系。Mamba虽能解决计算负担问题，但无法直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计预处理模块提取多层特征，创造性地设计基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块来融合双模态特征，结合Mamba和CNN优势构建更强主干网络。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，超越了Transformer的实验结果。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功利用了Mamba的低计算负担优势，探索了多模态特征融合的内部结构潜力，实现了更强的全图像理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中的投影层负责将视觉特征映射到语言模型空间，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 通过改造目标检测数据集为提示格式，设计训练/测试分割确保标签集不相交，从而精确控制已见和未见概念的分离。

Result: 实验结果显示投影层对未见类别的性能保持在已见类别的79-88%之间，表明即使没有对这些概念的显式对齐监督，也具有非平凡的泛化水平。

Conclusion: 投影层中的前馈网络类似键值记忆机制，以相似方式处理已见和未见标记。该研究为对齐泛化提供了新的评估框架，并展示了在有限对齐数据下高效训练VLM的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Conclusion: 提出的公平性算法为皮肤病变分类提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，能够在减少计算资源的同时确保诊断结果的公平性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，揭示视觉SAE特征的真实因果驱动因素，而不是单纯依赖激活位置，避免了自注意力机制导致的误解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制在整个图像中混合信息，激活的块往往只是与特征激活共存而非真正原因，这可能导致误解。

Method: 提出因果特征解释(CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)和输入归因技术，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，识别真正因果驱动该激活的图像块。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF映射经常与简单的激活映射不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系。块插入测试证实CaFE比基于激活排序的块更能有效恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的视觉SAE特征解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置进行解释的风险，为理解视觉transformer特征提供了更可靠的因果分析方法。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法能有效处理复杂现实世界的图像理解任务，为事件驱动的图像检索提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our

efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现检测变换器在人体-物体交互检测中存在"毒性兄弟"偏差问题，相似但不同的HOI三元组相互干扰竞争，提出了对比校准和合并拆分两种去偏学习目标来解决该问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测变换器在HOI检测中取得了显著进展，但研究发现存在"毒性兄弟"偏差问题，即大量相似但不同的HOI三元组在交互解码器的输入和输出端相互干扰竞争，导致学习效果下降

Method: 提出两种去偏学习目标：1）对比校准方法：采样类似兄弟的错误HOI三元组并重建为正确三元组，利用强位置先验指导；2）合并拆分方法：先学习兄弟类别间的共享特征以区分其他组，再显式细化组内差异以保持独特性

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HICO-Det数据集上显著超越基线方法（+9.18% mAP）和当前最先进方法（+3.59% mAP），在各种设置下都表现出色

Conclusion: 提出的两种去偏学习目标有效解决了HOI检测中的"毒性兄弟"偏差问题，显著提升了检测性能，为类似的多类别识别任务提供了有价值的解决方案

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Method: 开发了自动运动提取流水线，从45.8K个人-物交互视频中自动收集丰富的交互动作数据，构建包含文本描述的大规模数据集

Result: 实验表明InterPose显著提升了最先进的人体运动生成方法性能，并基于此开发了支持零样本动画的LLM智能体

Conclusion: InterPose数据集解决了人-物交互数据稀缺问题，为复杂场景中多样化对象操作的高保真人-物交互生成提供了重要基础

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Motivation: 现代人脸检索系统通常外包给第三方，存在严重的用户肖像隐私风险。同态加密虽然安全但计算效率低下，不适合实时应用

Method: 分层两阶段框架：1) 高通量可取消PQ索引模块用于快速候选过滤；2) 细粒度密文空间检索模块用于最终精确人脸排序。设计专门保护机制确保索引模块安全

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有效性、效率和安全性之间取得了良好平衡

Conclusion: 提出的Cancelable Product Quantization框架解决了安全人脸检索中的效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉假体的脑编码阶段难以生成具有足够生物相似性的脑信号，缺乏真实脑响应的监督信号来验证预测刺激的生物合理性，这是当前研究的关键问题。

Method: 使用预训练的CLIP视觉编码器提取图像语义表示，结合交叉注意力增强的U-Net扩散模型，通过迭代去噪过程学习重建生物合理的脑信号。交叉注意力模块实现了视觉特征与脑信号表示之间的动态交互。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG2和THINGS-MEG两个多模态数据集上验证了框架有效性，能够生成生物合理的脑信号，并可视化展示了被试内和被试间的M/EEG信号变化。

Conclusion: 提出的基于交叉注意力DDPM的框架成功解决了视觉假体脑编码阶段的生物合理性验证问题，为生成高质量脑信号提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniReason框架，通过联合建模动态3D环境及其决策过程来解决现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中忽视时间维度的问题。包含大规模数据集和新型智能体架构，在时空推理和可解释性方面取得显著进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽视了真实驾驶场景中至关重要的时间维度，这限制了自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 开发了OmniReason-Data数据集（包含密集时空标注和自然语言解释）和OmniReason-Agent架构（集成稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器），采用幻觉缓解的自动标注管道和时空知识蒸馏方法。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了时空推理能力，并为复杂动态环境中的可解释自动驾驶建立了新能力。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架成功解决了自动驾驶中时空推理的关键限制，通过大规模数据集和新型架构实现了在动态环境中可解释、时间感知的自主决策能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代检索和推理来提升知识密集型视觉问答的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理需要外部知识的视觉问题时表现有限，传统的单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，利用累积的推理记录动态制定多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新知识整合到推理记录中逐步优化理解

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等挑战性基准测试中，MI-RAG显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确率

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一种可扩展的方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Motivation: 水下3D重建面临光线失真、浑浊和能见度限制等挑战，现有AI方法尚未充分利用语言模型与视觉处理的整合潜力

Method: 在Gaussian Splatting框架中为每个高斯基元嵌入语义特征，使用CLIP提取的语义特征进行监督，提出语义一致性损失和分阶段训练策略

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集上全面超越现有方法，PSNR平均提升达3.09dB

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的候选方案，展示了多模态知识整合在复杂水下环境重建中的有效性

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Motivation: 胎儿超声标准平面分类面临组织对比度低、边界模糊和操作者依赖性等挑战，需要提升模型在真实图像质量变化下的性能。

Method: 使用浅层纹理敏感网络预测临床合理的对比度参数，通过可微分映射生成多个对比度增强视图，并在下游分类器中进行融合。

Conclusion: 该方法有效连接低层图像特征与高层语义，为医学图像分析在真实图像质量变化下建立了新范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Result: 相比现有SOTA方法，SDM展现更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，并能与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效的梯度攻击方法，通过创新的优化目标重构和三层框架设计，在对抗攻击领域取得了显著改进

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is

Motivation: 解决纹理表面缺陷检测中背景噪声干扰和缺陷边界模糊的问题，提高在噪声环境下的检测鲁棒性。

Method: 结合U-Net的局部特征训练和ViT的全局处理能力，使用高斯滤波损失函数去除背景噪声，采用盐椒噪声掩码强化纹理-缺陷边界，后处理使用Gabor滤波器突出缺陷方向频率特征。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多技术融合有效提升了纹理表面缺陷检测性能，特别是在噪声环境下表现出色，为工业检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用两步流程（先估计相机位姿再优化3D高斯）在运动模糊严重时会导致位姿估计错误，进而影响重建质量。需要一种统一优化框架来同时处理相机和物体运动。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为3D高斯的每基元SE(3)仿射变换，提出三阶段训练策略：先固定位姿训练高斯，再固定高斯优化位姿，最后联合优化所有参数。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实场景序列上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量和位姿估计精度方面显著优于现有的动态去模糊方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一的端到端优化框架，成功解决了动态3D场景重建中的运动模糊问题，为AR/VR、机器人和自主导航等应用提供了更可靠的重建方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Conclusion: SegDINO证明了通过简单有效的设计可以充分利用预训练基础模型的表征能力，为高效分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种将单视图新视角合成分解为360度场景外推和视角插值的两阶段方法，通过全景扩散模型和视频扩散模型确保长距离视角一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单图像新视角合成方法在处理大幅偏离输入视角或长距离轨迹时，难以保持场景一致性和正确的视角对齐，特别是在闭环场景中

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用全景扩散模型从输入图像学习场景先验并生成360度全景；2) 从全景中采样并扭曲关键帧，通过预训练视频扩散模型进行空间噪声扩散来生成新视角

Result: 在多样化场景数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成连贯视图方面优于现有方法，即使在闭环场景中也能保持全局一致性

Conclusion: 该方法通过场景外推和视角插值的分解策略，成功解决了单视图新视角合成中的长距离一致性问题，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT方法主要关注ID数据性能，忽视了OOD数据上的性能退化问题。研究发现QAT导致损失景观尖锐化，与平坦损失景观有利于OOD泛化的观点相矛盾

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）层间冻结机制缓解双重优化目标间的梯度冲突；2）基于梯度无序度量的自适应冻结算法动态确定冻结层；3）设计梯度无序度量识别训练中的不稳定层

Result: 在重要OOD基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法在ID和OOD图像分类任务中均优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: FQAT通过平坦化导向的量化感知训练，成功解决了QAT导致的OOD泛化性能下降问题，实现了可泛化的量化训练

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI脊柱侧弯筛查方法主要依赖轮廓数据，忽略了临床相关的姿态不对称性指标。姿态数据能提供更直观的骨骼表示，但面临数据集稀缺和原始坐标噪声敏感两大挑战。

Method: 构建了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集（447,900帧2D关键点），提出双表征框架(DRF)：结合连续骨架图保持空间结构，使用离散姿态不对称向量(PAV)编码临床不对称描述符，并通过PAV引导注意力模块(PGA)指导特征提取。

Result: DRF实现了最先进的性能，可视化证实模型能够利用临床不对称线索指导特征提取，促进双表征之间的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了姿态数据在脊柱侧弯筛查中的挑战，数据集和代码已公开，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活值并保留最高分token，同时使用语义记忆库和两级排名机制来提升prompt tuning的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功表明prompt tuning可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本，需要一种同时提升准确性和效率的方法。

Method: Spotlighter从样本层面和语义层面评估每个视觉token的激活，保留最高分token；使用类别特定语义记忆库学习原型来精化选择；引入两级排名机制动态加权token-原型交互。

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升高达11.19%，额外实现0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是prompt tuning中有效且可扩展的基线方法，在准确性和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

TL;DR: DarkVRAI是一个针对低光照RAW视频去噪的新框架，在AIM 2025挑战赛中获第一名，通过条件化元数据引导和BOSS机制建模长程时序依赖，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照RAW视频去噪面临严重信号退化问题，由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间的限制，传统方法难以处理视频帧率要求下的噪声问题。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：(1)将图像去噪的条件化方案成功应用于视频去噪，利用捕获元数据指导对齐和去噪过程；(2)提出Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS)机制，有效建模噪声视频序列中的长程时序依赖关系。

Result: 在严格且真实的基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能，为低光照视频去噪设立了新标准。

Conclusion: DarkVRAI通过协同结合条件化元数据引导和BOSS时序建模机制，成功解决了低光照RAW视频去噪的挑战性问题。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频令牌压缩方法采用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 使用轻量级语言模型生成视频片段的描述，转换为软字幕令牌作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例。

Result: 相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs计算量，同时保持竞争性性能表现，能够根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整令牌压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC通过语言感知的动态令牌压缩机制，有效解决了固定压缩比例的问题，实现了计算效率与性能的良好平衡，模拟了人类根据场景复杂度动态表达的方式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了如何在3D高斯泼溅框架中有效整合RGB和多光谱图像数据，提出了三种优化策略并验证了联合优化方法在光谱重建和RGB增强方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然3DGS在RGB数据上表现出色，但直接对额外光谱波段进行优化会导致重建质量下降，因为不同光谱域中的几何结构出现不一致，尽管实际几何是相同的。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1）独立每波段重建；2）分割优化（先优化RGB几何然后复制拟合新波段）；3）联合优化（可选的RGB初始化阶段）。建议将多光谱数据直接整合到球谐颜色组件中。

Result: 通过定量指标和定性新视角渲染展示了专用优化联合策略的有效性，提高了整体光谱重建质量，并通过光谱串扰增强了RGB结果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在优化过程中何时以及如何引入光谱波段的关键权衡，为鲁棒的多模态3DGS重建提供了实用见解，建议直接整合多光谱数据到球谐颜色组件中。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Motivation: 雨天显著增加道路事故风险，了解经验丰富的司机在恶劣天气条件下的视觉感知适应行为，对于设计鲁棒的驾驶员监控系统和高级驾驶辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法分析眼动数据：首先在10秒间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心聚合成元聚类。结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线仰角和方位角分布等指标进行分析。

Result: 虽然整体注视行为（关注道路并偶尔检查后视镜）保持一致，但雨天条件下导致更频繁的仪表盘扫视、更长的注视时间和更高的视线仰角，表明认知专注度增加。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了恶劣条件下视觉注意力模式的宝贵见解，并强调了利用眼动建模辅助设计更鲁棒的ADAS和DMS的潜力。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: CompSlider通过解耦多属性和在潜在空间操作，实现了高效精确的多属性控制，为文本到图像生成提供了更可靠的滑块控制解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多种真实玻璃污染物，通过测试时自适应机制实现了对未知污染类型的良好泛化能力

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Conclusion: LPFM为病理学低级别图像增强提供了首个统一解决方案，能够有效处理多种退化问题和虚拟染色需求，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Motivation: 医学图像异常检测需要高效率和准确性，但现有CNN模型感受野有限，Transformer模型计算成本过高。Mamba架构在自然语言处理中展现出的长序列处理能力和线性复杂度为医学图像检测提供了新思路。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力(HSFA)块来分别学习高低频特征，防止高频信息丢失；使用视觉状态空间模块(VSSM)和希尔伯特曲线扫描技术来增强空间相关性和局部依赖关系。

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功将Mamba架构应用于医学图像检测，通过频率-空间特征融合和优化的扫描策略，在计算效率和检测精度方面都表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

*Chenlu Zhan,Wen Li,Chuyu Shen,Jun Zhang,Suhui Wu,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了双向稀疏注意力框架BSA，通过动态稀疏化查询和键值对来显著提升视频扩散Transformer的训练和推理效率，在保持生成质量的同时减少20倍计算量和17.79倍训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在处理高分辨率长视频时面临二次复杂度的计算瓶颈，全注意力机制导致训练和推理成本过高，需要解决查询和键值对的稀疏性问题。

Method: 提出双向稀疏注意力框架BSA：1）通过语义相似性和动态时空训练策略选择信息量最大的查询token；2）使用统计动态阈值保留最重要的键值块进行计算，实现双向稀疏化。

Result: BSA显著加速了长序列DiT训练，FLOPs减少高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，同时保持甚至超越了全注意力的生成质量。

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频扩散Transformer的计算效率问题，为高质量长视频生成提供了可行的解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

### [231] [An End-to-End Framework for Video Multi-Person Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01095)
*Zhihong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEPE是一个端到端的视频姿态估计框架，使用时空Transformer组件解决传统两阶段方法的效率低下和时空分离问题，在Posetrack数据集上表现优异且推理效率提升300%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频姿态估计方法将空间和时间维度分离，依赖独立检测器和复杂后处理，导致推理效率低下且无法进行端到端优化，无法有效利用全局时空上下文信息。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：时空姿态编码器(STPE)、时空可变形记忆编码器(STDME)和时空姿态解码器(STPD)，并引入实例一致性机制来增强跨帧实例查询的一致性和差异性。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于大多数两阶段模型，推理效率提升了300%。

Conclusion: VEPE框架通过端到端设计和时空Transformer组件的有效结合，成功解决了传统方法的效率问题和时空分离限制，实现了高效准确的视频姿态估计。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PVINet点云压缩网络，通过点-体素交错结构并行提取全局结构和局部上下文特征，并引入条件稀疏卷积实现特征交互，在基准数据集上达到竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云压缩方法通常顺序处理全局和局部信息，缺乏两者之间的有效通信，导致重建质量受限

Method: 使用体素编码器提取全局结构特征，点编码器建模局部上下文，通过新颖的条件稀疏卷积实现点嵌入到体素特征的自适应核定制，解码时利用点嵌入指导重建

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，PVINet相比最先进方法具有竞争性性能

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行特征提取和交互机制有效提升了点云压缩的重建质量，条件稀疏卷积是实现特征交互的关键创新

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [233] [FICGen: Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement for Layout-driven Degraded Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01107)
*Wenzhuang Wang,Yifan Zhao,Mingcan Ma,Ming Liu,Zhonglin Jiang,Yong Chen,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FICGen方法，通过频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式，解决退化场景下布局到图像生成中的上下文幻觉困境，显著提升了生成保真度和布局对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局到图像生成方法在退化场景（如低光照、水下）中面临生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐性弱的问题，主要原因是前景实例被上下文主导的频率分布所淹没的"上下文幻觉困境"。

Method: 提出FICGen范式：1）使用可学习的双查询机制和频率重采样器从训练集中提取上下文频率原型；2）采用视觉频率增强注意力将频率原型注入退化生成过程；3）开发实例一致性图和自适应空间频率聚合模块来调节实例与周围环境的潜在空间解耦。

Result: 在5个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FICGen在各种退化场景（从严重低光照到轻度模糊）中 consistently超越现有L2I方法，在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FICGen通过将退化图像的频率知识转移到潜在扩散空间，有效解决了退化场景下的上下文幻觉问题，为布局到图像生成在挑战性环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

### [234] [GPSToken: Gaussian Parameterized Spatially-adaptive Tokenization for Image Representation and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01109)
*Zhengqiang Zhang,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种新型的非均匀图像标记化框架，使用2D高斯参数化动态建模不同图像区域的形状、位置和纹理，实现了比传统均匀网格方法更灵活有效的图像表示和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均匀2D/1D网格的标记化方法无法灵活表示不同形状、纹理和位置的图像区域，限制了特征表示的有效性。

Method: 采用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀的可变大小区域，每个区域用2D高斯参数化（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征表示，通过专用transformer优化高斯参数，使用可微分的splatting渲染器重建特征图。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务上，使用128个token实现了rFID 0.65和FID 1.50的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过高斯参数化空间自适应标记化，实现了非均匀图像表示，解耦了空间布局和纹理特征，支持高效的两阶段生成流程。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

### [235] [MetaSSL: A General Heterogeneous Loss for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01144)
*Weiren Zhao,Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Wenjun Liao,Sichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MetaSSL框架，通过空间异质性损失函数为不同像素分配不同权重，同时利用参考预测和监督预测之间的不确定性和一致性信息，提升半监督医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，但忽视了标注数据中的潜在噪声以及不同未标注像素的异质性价值。需要更有效地挖掘两个预测中包含的丰富信息。

Method: 将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），使用自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测，并为每个区域分配递减的权重。该异质性损失也应用于标注图像以应对标注噪声。

Result: 实验结果表明，当与现有SSL框架集成时，该方法在不同数据集上显著提高了分割性能。

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一个即插即用的通用框架，能够有效提升半监督医学图像分割的效果，通过空间异质性损失更好地利用预测信息。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的端到端多视角行人跟踪方法MVTrajecter，通过利用过去多个时间戳的轨迹信息进行更鲁棒的关联


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端MVPT方法仅依赖当前和单个相邻过去时间戳，忽略了更早的轨迹历史信息，限制了关联性能

Method: 引入轨迹运动成本和轨迹外观成本，基于多个时间戳信息计算行人身份相似性；利用注意力机制捕捉多时间戳间关系

Result: 大量实验证明各组件有效性，性能优于之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: 利用多时间戳轨迹信息能显著提升多视角行人跟踪的关联鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型依赖视觉语言编码器进行关键帧采样，但不确定这些编码器是否能真正识别出最具信息量的帧，需要验证其有效性。

Method: 通过实证研究分析流行视觉编码器在识别视频关键帧方面的能力，检验它们是否能准确指导MLLM关注视频中与文本查询相关的区域。

Result: 研究发现当前流行的视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面存在严重局限性，无法有效识别出MLLM应该关注的最具信息量的视频帧。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术来提升高效视频多模态大语言模型的性能，当前视觉编码器的局限性可能阻碍视频理解任务的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

TL;DR: DynaMind是一个从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的新框架，通过联合建模神经动力学和语义特征，显著提升了视频重建的准确性和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景时面临空间分辨率低、时间不匹配和语义信息利用不足的问题，导致无法充分解析动态连贯性和复杂语义上下文。

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列确保时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时序蓝图转换为高保真视频。

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA，视频和帧级准确率分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%，显示出卓越的视觉保真度和时间连贯性。

Conclusion: 这项工作在神经动力学和高保真视觉语义之间架起了关键桥梁，标志着脑解码领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多主体个性化图像生成面临主体保真度保持和跨主体属性泄漏的挑战，需要在不进行测试时优化的情况下实现对多个指定主体的精细独立控制。

Method: 基于动态语义对应和监督图像复杂度自适应识别焦点区域，在训练过程中跨噪声时间步渐进调整焦点区域，采用加权策略奖励信息丰富区域并惩罚低置信度区域，根据参考图像语义复杂度动态调整DPO过程中的焦点分配。

Result: 在现有预训练个性化生成模型上显著提升性能，在单主体和多主体个性化图像合成基准测试中达到最先进水平，有效缓解属性泄漏同时保持优异的主体保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了可控多主体图像合成的前沿，在各种生成场景中都能有效保持主体保真度并防止属性泄漏。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督分割质量评估方法存在评估粒度粗糙、评估不完整和迁移性差的问题，需要一种更全面、精细的像素级评估方案。

Method: 使用改进的SAM架构，将输入掩码作为提示进行特征整合；引入边缘引导压缩分支和聚合语义过滤模块处理边缘区域；采用增强混合采样训练策略提升跨域鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了鲁棒且可迁移的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code
is available at https://github.com/Yangbn97/SegAssess.

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

TL;DR: PRINTER是一个弱监督框架，通过原型驱动的内容染色模式解耦和变形感知对抗学习策略，实现H&E到IHC的虚拟染色，解决组织切片空间错位问题

Conclusion: 该工作为虚拟染色提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学领域的发展

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Result: 在ScanObjectNN的三个变体上，使用Mlp-Linear评估协议，比自重建基线(Point-MAE)分别提升了6.5%、7.0%和6.7%

Conclusion: 双视图交叉重建相比自重建显著增加了预训练难度，使该方法在3D自监督学习领域超越了之前的单模态自重建方法

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Conclusion: 这项工作首次将NAS引入SAR目标检测，为利用NAS解决实际应用问题提供了新的视角

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable

Motivation: 现有的跨域少样本分割方法通常设计多个独立模块来增强特征表示的跨域泛化能力，但这些模块之间的独立性阻碍了知识的有效流动，难以充分发挥它们的集体潜力。

Method: 提出FSS-TIs方法，假设域特定特征和域无关特征的频谱（包括幅度和相位谱）之间存在ODE关系，通过ODE公式产生沿时间间隔序列的迭代变换过程，同时对频谱应用带有随机扰动的仿射变换。

Result: 在五个不同领域的数据集上进行了评估，实验结果表明FSS-TIs优于现有的CD-FSS方法，深入的消融研究进一步验证了其跨域适应性。

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过将域无关特征表示空间的探索和多样化潜在目标域分布的模拟重新表述为ODE内在参数的优化过程，提供了一种结构简洁且有效的跨域少样本分割解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain

*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个端到端框架，联合处理激光雷达超分辨率和语义分割，使用轻量级架构和新的损失函数，在低成本16通道LiDAR上达到接近64通道高分辨率LiDAR的分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR成本高昂限制了大规模部署，而低成本传感器产生的稀疏点云会降低分割精度，需要解决这一矛盾

Method: 采用联合优化训练框架，SR模块融入语义线索，使用新的超分辨率损失函数聚焦感兴趣区域，轻量级模型架构参数更少

Result: 实验表明该方法在分割性能上可与使用昂贵64通道高分辨率LiDAR数据的模型相媲美

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了低成本LiDAR传感器在自动驾驶3D语义分割中的性能限制问题，为大规模部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

TL;DR: PGRD是一种基于扩散模型的医学图像分割框架，通过学习体素级分布来捕捉分割的不确定性，具有强校准性和采样效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割存在模糊性，需要模型捕捉完整的条件分布而非单点估计，现有方法在校准性和采样效率方面存在不足

Method: 将离散标签嵌入连续空间对齐分割与扩散建模，使用粗粒度先验预测器提供步进指导，扩散网络学习残差加速收敛，采用深度扩散监督方案稳定训练

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD相比贝叶斯、集成、概率U-Net和普通扩散基线获得更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，且需要更少采样步骤

Conclusion: PGRD框架有效解决了医学图像分割的不确定性问题，在保持强校准性的同时显著提高了采样效率

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges: detecting small, dense, and
overlapping objects (a major hurdle in computer vision) and improving the
quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial
environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised
deep learning. We perform an analysis of these methods, using a newly de-
veloped dataset comprising over 10k images and 120k in- stances. By evaluating
their performance, accuracy, and com- putational efficiency, we identify the
most reliable detection systems and highlight the specific challenges they
address in industrial applications. This paper also examines the use of deep
learning models to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments. We
introduce a lightweight model based on a fully connected convolutional network.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于检索增强生成的多模态大语言模型方法，用于街景图像地理定位，无需微调即可实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和智能手机摄像头的普及，传统计算机视觉技术在图像定位方面面临挑战，需要更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集上构建向量数据库，通过检索相似和不相似的地理位置信息来增强查询图像提示，再由多模态大语言模型处理。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实现了更高的准确率，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为地理定位提供了一种无需从头训练模型的替代路径，为GeoAI领域带来了更易获取和可扩展的解决方案新可能性。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Method: 采用多模态深度学习框架，包含土壤分类模块（ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0、Vision Transformer）和作物推荐模块（MLP、XGBoost、LightGBM、TabNet），分析土壤图像和结构化营养数据

Result: 融合模型达到98.0%准确率，精确率97.8%，召回率97.7%，F1分数96.75%，RMSE和MAE分别降至0.32和0.27

Conclusion: AgroSense为精准农业提供了实用、可扩展的实时决策支持解决方案，并为资源受限环境中的轻量级多模态AI系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret是一个统一的医学图像检索模型，通过自监督学习在包含2D、3D和视频的多模态医学数据集上训练，无需模态特定定制，在零样本检索和跨模态对齐方面达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法针对不同模态使用分离的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定的设计限制了可扩展性，阻碍了统一表示的发展。

Method: 构建包含867,653个医学影像样本的大规模混合模态数据集，使用生成式(MAE)和对比式(SimDINO)自监督学习范式训练统一的视觉编码器M3Ret，无需任何模态特定定制。

Result: 在所有单个模态的零样本图像检索中达到新SOTA，超越DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等强基线；在没有配对数据的情况下实现强跨模态对齐；模型泛化到未见过的MRI任务，尽管预训练期间从未见过MRI数据。

Conclusion: M3Ret展示了纯视觉自监督学习对未见模态的泛化能力，为多模态医学图像理解的基础模型发展迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Motivation: 解决身份保持文本到视频生成中数据稀缺和微调成本高的问题，通过无需训练的方法提升生成质量

Method: 1) 使用GPT-4o进行面部感知提示增强；2) 使用身份保持图像生成器进行提示感知参考图像增强；3) 采用ID感知时空引导增强联合优化身份保持和视频质量

Result: 在1000个视频测试集上通过自动和人工评估验证，在ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛中获第一名，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: TPIGE框架以最小成本实现了身份保持文本到视频生成的显著性能提升，具有很强的通用性

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究证明了将摄像头运动特性纳入系统设计对于可转向摄像头实时视频分析的重要性，Uirapuru框架为动态场景下的高性能分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust

Motivation: 现有方法在处理部分相关视频检索时容易受到虚假语义关联的干扰，主要面临查询歧义和部分视频相关性两个数据不确定性挑战

Method: 1) 将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模；2) 引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度；3) 作为即插即用解决方案集成到现有架构中

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: RAL框架通过显式建模数据不确定性，能够有效提升部分相关视频检索的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: RibPull是一种利用隐式占用场连接计算几何和医学影像的方法，通过神经占用场表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取中轴，相比体素方法能更好地处理稀疏数据和几何操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素网格在医学影像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而基于坐标的隐式表示能更好地保持复杂几何信息并处理稀疏数据。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩算法提取胸腔的中轴线。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了连续坐标基3D场景表示相比体素基表示的优越性。

Conclusion: 隐式占用场方法为医学影像中的几何操作提供了更有效的解决方案，特别是在处理稀疏数据和复杂几何结构时表现出色。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注语义控制，但忽视了保持风格一致性的重要性，这影响了图像的整体美感和连贯性。

Method: 提出Neural Scene Designer框架，采用双并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息，并设计了渐进式自风格表示学习模块，通过风格对比损失来学习细粒度风格表示。

Result: 在建立的综合基准测试中进行了广泛实验，证明了该框架在保持风格一致性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，为语义控制和风格保持提供了有效的解决方案，并通过建立标准化评估基准推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

TL;DR: MILO是一个轻量级的多尺度感知度量方法，用于全参考图像质量评估，既可作为先进的图像质量指标，也可作为生成管道中感知优化的实用工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统图像质量评估方法需要大规模人工标注数据的问题，并开发一个既能准确评估图像质量又能用于实时应用的轻量级度量方法。

Method: 使用伪MOS监督训练，通过对多样化图像应用可重现的失真并使用考虑视觉掩蔽效应的质量度量集合进行评分。在潜在空间优化中结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略。

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中优于现有度量方法，推理速度快适合实时应用。在去噪、超分辨率和人脸修复等任务中显著提升性能，同时减少计算开销。

Conclusion: MILO不仅是一个最先进的图像质量度量方法，还是一个在生成管道中进行感知优化的实用工具，通过空间掩蔽和课程学习策略实现了高效且感知对齐的优化。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

Conclusion: PointSlice在多个数据集上验证了其有效性，实现了高速推理和较少参数的同时保持高检测精度，为3D点云处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Motivation: nnUNet框架虽然能自动调整训练超参数，但忽略了分割网络内部超参数的优化，限制了模型的泛化能力。需要解决卷积核尺寸固定无法适应不同数据集特征的问题。

Method: 提出自适应卷积模块，根据数据集特征动态调整卷积核大小。将该模块集成到MSA2-Net的两个关键组件：多尺度卷积桥和多尺度融合解码器中，分别用于细化Transformer输出和捕获不同尺寸器官的细节信息。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,

Motivation: HIFU治疗的成功和安全性依赖于实时监测，但超声引导HIFU治疗时存在干扰问题，影响监测效果。

Method: 采用Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)将含噪超声图像编码到低维潜在空间，然后使用潜在扩散模型迭代去除干扰，最后解码重建高清无干扰图像。

Result: 在体外实验中，HIFU-ILDiff的SSIM达到0.796，PSNR达到23.780，显著优于Notch Filter的0.443和14.420；处理速度达到15帧/秒，远快于Notch Filter的5秒/帧。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪HIFU干扰，提高治疗精度，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感数据集缺乏时序图像对和详细文本标注，单时相图像无法捕捉灾害动态影响，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建大规模RSCC基准数据集，涵盖地震、洪水、野火等多种灾害类型，提供人工撰写的丰富变化描述文本。

Result: RSCC数据集能够支持详细的灾害相关分析，为遥感领域的视觉语言应用提供更准确、可解释和可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: RSCC数据集通过弥合遥感数据中的时间和语义鸿沟，为灾害感知的双时相理解提供了强有力的训练和评估基准，推动了遥感视觉语言应用的发展。

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture
dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the
Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,
interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

TL;DR: Keye-VL-1.5是一个针对视频理解的多模态大语言模型，通过慢快视频编码策略、渐进式预训练和综合后训练流程，显著提升了视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理视频内容时面临空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间的权衡问题，视频理解仍然是具有挑战性的领域。

Method: 采用慢快视频编码策略（基于帧间相似性动态分配计算资源）、四阶段渐进式预训练（从8K扩展到128K tokens）以及包含思维链数据构建、GSPO强化学习和对齐训练的综合后训练流程。

Result: 在公共基准测试和内部人工评估中表现出显著改进，在视频理解任务中表现优异，同时在通用多模态基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Keye-VL-1.5通过创新的编码策略、训练方法和后处理技术，成功解决了视频理解中的关键挑战，为多模态视频分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RocketScience是一个开源的对比视觉语言模型基准测试，专门测试空间关系理解能力，包含全新的真实世界图像-文本对，主要涵盖相对空间理解和物体顺序。该基准对人类来说很简单，但对当前VLM模型来说很困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间关系理解方面存在明显不足，需要建立一个专门的基准来测试和评估模型的空间推理能力，特别是相对空间关系和物体顺序的理解。

Method: 创建了一个全新的真实世界图像-文本对数据集，设计对人类简单但对VLM困难的测试任务，进行解耦分析以分离物体定位和空间推理的贡献，使用思维链模型进行评估。

Result: 结果显示开源和前沿商业VLM在空间关系理解方面存在显著缺陷，而推理模型表现意外优秀。性能瓶颈在于空间推理能力而非物体定位能力。

Conclusion: 空间关系理解是当前VLM的重要短板，需要专门的数据集和评估方法来推动该领域的发展。RocketScience基准以CC-BY-4.0许可证发布，评估代码开源提供。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一个无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，采用轻量级对称双视图关联模型作为前端，后端构建专门的Sim(3)位姿图，在相机追踪和3D重建质量方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个不需要相机内参的通用视觉SLAM系统，使其能够适用于各种不同的相机设置，同时降低模型复杂度并提高性能

Method: 使用轻量级对称双视图关联(STA)模型作为前端，同时估计相对相机位姿和从两个RGB图像回归局部点云图；后端构建包含闭环检测的Sim(3)位姿图来处理累积漂移

Result: 前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，在相机追踪和密集3D重建质量方面实现了优于当前方法的性能

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个高效且通用的视觉SLAM解决方案，无需相机内参知识，在保持轻量级设计的同时实现了卓越的性能表现

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit是一个统一的视频编辑框架，通过创新的对象失真控制信号和复制形式保护模块，实现了高效、高质量的多任务视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中需要为不同编辑任务设计不同的控制信号，导致模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源，因此需要一种统一的控制方法。

Method: 提出对象失真控制(O-DisCo)信号，基于随机和自适应噪声，将多种编辑线索封装在单一表示中，配合复制形式保护模块来保持未编辑区域。

Result: 在广泛实验和人类评估中，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务上超越了专业和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个统一且高效的解决方案，能够灵活处理多种视频编辑需求，同时保持高保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的编码器-解码器视觉Transformer模型，用于从双视角X射线图像同时进行导管分割和3D力估计，在合成X射线图像上表现优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务深度学习模型使用CNN架构处理导管手术中的触觉和视觉感知数据，但需要逐步扩展感受野来捕获长距离依赖关系。本文希望从新角度解决这个问题。

Method: 提出基于Vision Transformer的编码器-解码器模型，将两个输入X射线图像作为独立序列处理，通过Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系，使用共享分割头和回归头分别进行导管分割和3D力估计。

Result: 模型在合成X射线图像上进行了广泛实验，与最先进的分割模型、视觉导管力估计方法以及多任务方法相比，在导管分割和力估计两方面都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的立体视觉Transformer模型能够同时从两个角度分割导管并估计其尖端产生的3D力，为导管手术提供了更有效的多任务感知解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

*Jefferson Hernandez,Jing Shi,Simon Jenni,Vicente Ordonez,Kushal Kafle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Panel-of-Peers学习框架，通过多模型协作评估和迭代自改进，无需大量人工标注数据即可提升大视觉语言模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖人工标注偏好数据成本高，机器生成数据质量有限，自监督数据容易产生幻觉，需要更有效的对齐方案

Method: 采用Panel-of-Peers框架，模拟同行评审系统，让多个LVLM模型组成专家组，通过迭代生成、评估和精炼输出来实现协作学习

Result: 在15个基准测试中平均得分从48%提升到57%，显著改善模型性能

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers方法证明了同行评估作为自监督对齐可扩展替代方案的潜力，能够有效提升模型性能而无需大量人工标注数据

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过修改扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，few-step方法虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩模型，现有后训练量化方法需要全精度校准，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过调整few-step采样轨迹实现量化；设计JAQ损失函数结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标，无需全精度推理即可进行细粒度优化。

Result: 相比FP16 4步潜在一致性模型提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8步分阶段一致性模型提升16.6% FID，大规模用户研究（80,000+标注）证实了在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上的有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成中具有互补性，Q-Sched为高效扩散模型推理提供了新思路，避免了传统量化方法对全精度校准的依赖。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVision 2通过移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性，同时保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化OpenVision架构和损失设计，提升训练效率，借鉴CapPa、AIMv2和LLaVA等多模态设计思路。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失作为纯生成训练信号，保持ViT-L/14视觉编码器。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83h→57h），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批量大小从2k增至8k，参数量超10亿，在多模态基准测试中保持竞争性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级纯生成范式对未来多模态基础模型中视觉编码器发展具有吸引力，展示了高效训练和扩展的潜力。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

Motivation: 多光谱图像数据维度高且处理复杂，多标签分类进一步增加了特征提取的难度，需要研究降维方法的有效性

Method: 使用ResNet50和DINOv2架构，在分类器前加入可选的PCA步骤将数据降至三维，然后输入三层分类器

Result: PCA的有效性强烈依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略，不同架构对PCA的响应不同

Conclusion: 研究为自监督预训练和替代降维方法的未来研究开辟了道路，PCA在多标签多光谱分类中的应用需要根据具体架构进行优化

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Motivation: 岩石尺寸精确分类对岩土工程、采矿和资源管理至关重要，影响运营效率和安全，需要更准确的分类方法

Method: 在ConvNeXt基础上构建CNSCA模型，引入自注意力机制捕获长距离空间依赖，通道注意力机制强调信息丰富的特征通道，形成混合设计

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临床元数据的双阶段扩散框架，用于解决有限角度CT重建中的伪影问题，通过元数据引导生成先验并整合物理约束，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT虽然能提高时间分辨率和减少辐射剂量，但由于投影数据截断导致严重伪影，需要解决这一病态重建问题。

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段使用基于transformer的扩散模型，仅依赖临床元数据（采集参数、患者人口统计和诊断印象）从噪声生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段整合粗略先验和元数据生成高保真结果，每个采样步骤都通过ADMM模块强制物理数据一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，元数据整合显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断情况下。相比无元数据基线，在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上表现更优。消融研究确认不同类型元数据提供互补优势。

Conclusion: 临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面发挥双重作用，支持将其整合到未来的元数据引导医学成像框架中。

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Conclusion: 这项工作证实了通过利用基础模型的知识可以可行地控制图像光照，实现了实用且通用的重光照功能。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构比任何单独组件性能显著更好，上下文基因、ST潜在空间和邻居条件都是关键创新组件。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be
available at: https://github.com/wengzp1/GARLSR.

Conclusion: 这是首个将可解释性引入地理定位的工作，通过概念瓶颈方法同时提升了模型性能和解释能力

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个针对多主体个性化生成的表示中心框架，通过显式语义对应和正交特征解耦来解决身份混合和属性泄漏问题，在4+参考主体情况下仍能保持高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多主体个性化生成在保持身份保真度和语义连贯性方面面临挑战，现有方法由于对主体在共享表示空间中如何交互的建模不足，容易出现身份混合和属性泄漏问题。

Method: 提出SemAlign-MS数据集提供细粒度语义对应，引入语义对应注意力损失确保精确的点对点语义对齐，开发多参考解耦损失将不同主体推入正交注意力子空间以防止特征干扰。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，现有方法通常在3个主体以上性能下降，而MOSAIC在4+参考主体情况下仍能保持高保真度。

Conclusion: MOSAIC通过精确的语义对齐和特征解耦，为复杂的多主体合成应用开辟了新可能性，解决了多主体生成中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了VARIN方法，首次为视觉自回归模型(VAR)设计了基于噪声反转的图像编辑技术，通过位置感知argmax反演生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现精确的图像重建和文本引导的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然条件生成已被广泛研究，但无需额外训练即可实现提示引导图像编辑的能力同样重要，因为它支持众多实际应用。本文旨在探索VAR模型在文本到图像编辑方面的能力。

Method: 提出Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN)方法，使用新颖的Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI)伪逆函数进行argmax采样，生成逆Gumbel噪声来实现精确图像重建和可控编辑。

Result: 大量实验表明，VARIN能有效根据指定提示修改源图像，同时显著保留原始背景和结构细节，验证了其作为实用编辑方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VARIN是首个专门为VAR模型设计的基于噪声反转的编辑技术，通过逆噪声生成实现了精确的图像重建和文本引导的可控编辑，在保持原始图像结构的同时实现了有效的编辑效果。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

*Ziyun Zeng,Junhao Zhang,Wei Li,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Draw-In-Mind (DIM)数据集和模型，通过将设计责任明确分配给理解模块来解决多模态模型中图像编辑的精确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型在文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在精确图像编辑方面存在困难，主要原因是理解模块和生成模块之间的责任分配不平衡。理解模块仅作为翻译器，而生成模块需要同时承担设计师和画家的角色。

Method: 构建DIM数据集，包含两个子集：DIM-T2I（1400万长上下文图像-文本对）和DIM-Edit（23.3万GPT-4o生成的思维链想象）。通过两层MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B，在DIM数据集上训练得到DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit模型。

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，超越了UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit等更大模型。

Conclusion: 将设计责任明确分配给理解模块能显著提升图像编辑性能，证明了该方法在解决多模态模型责任分配不平衡问题上的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新颖的方法，通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图并引入熵和距离控制参数，来改善文本到图像扩散模型对用户指定调色板的遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板在创意工作流中广泛使用，但用于图像生成时存在显著模糊性和不稳定性，需要解决这种条件控制的挑战。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个标量控制参数，还设计了负直方图机制来抑制不需要的色调，并在精心策划的数据集上训练以确保颜色空间的广泛泛化。

Result: 该方法能够在广泛的调色板和提示下实现稳定、语义连贯的生成，在定性、定量评估和用户研究中一致优于现有方法，在调色板遵循度和图像质量方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter通过创新的直方图解释和控制机制，成功解决了调色板条件控制的挑战，为文本到图像生成提供了更精确和灵活的颜色控制能力。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于视觉的非侵入式智能监测系统，使用轻量级MobileNet模型在Raspberry Pi上实现新生儿行为状态的实时检测，适用于资源稀缺环境的早产儿护理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产是新生儿死亡的主要原因，特别是在资源稀缺地区。目前的手动监测和侵入式传感器存在错误多、不实用和可能造成皮肤损伤等问题，需要一种自动化、非侵入式的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一种嵌入式监测系统，采用量化的MobileNet模型部署在Raspberry Pi上，实现实时行为状态检测。系统集成了三项关键技术：模型量化减少内存占用（68%减少）、Raspberry Pi优化视觉处理流程、安全IoT通信用于临床抨报。

Result: 系统在公开新生儿图像数据集上达到了领先的准确率：睡眠检测91.8%，哭哭/正常分类97.7%。通过对比分析发现，较大模型如ResNet152、VGG19虽然准确率略高，但计算成本过高不适合实时边缘部署。

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型如MobileNet是建立可扩展、低成本、临床可行动的NICU监测系统的最可行基础，为改善资源稀缺环境中的早产儿护理推广平坦了道路。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得了进展，但其可靠性和鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索。本文从设计逻辑角度分析RMOT系统的安全影响，识别对抗性漏洞。

Method: 提出了VEIL对抗攻击框架，通过精心设计的数字和物理扰动来破坏RMOT模型的统一指代匹配机制。特别针对采用FIFO内存的先进RMOT模型，发现时空推理中的定向持续攻击会在历史缓冲区中引入持久错误。

Result: 在Refer-KITTI数据集上的综合评估验证了VEIL的有效性，能够破坏跟踪逻辑的可靠性，诱导跟踪ID切换和终止。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明RMOT系统存在严重的安全漏洞，迫切需要为关键大规模应用开发安全感知的RMOT设计。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Result: 研究结果突出了合成数据在自监督学习中的潜力和局限性，为未来工作提供了见解。

Conclusion: 合成增强训练可以产生更鲁棒和可迁移的视觉表示，但合成数据的使用仍存在局限性，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

Motivation: 现有slot attention方法存在两个关键局限：(1)缺乏高层语义信息，仅基于颜色纹理等低层特征分配图像区域；(2)无法微调编码器，限制了对象中心学习的灵活性

Method: 提出ContextFusion阶段利用前景和背景的语义信息，加入辅助指示器提供额外上下文线索；Bootstrap Branch将特征适应与重构阶段解耦，通过引导策略训练特征适应机制

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著提升了不同SOTA slot attention模型在模拟和真实数据集上的性能

Conclusion: 所提出的ContextFusion和Bootstrap Branch能够无缝集成到现有slot attention模型中，有效解决了语义信息不足和编码器灵活性受限的问题

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 行人属性识别(PAR)面临训练数据集中某些属性代表性不足的问题，传统复杂方法受限于数据集限制，识别性能难以提升。

Method: 首先定义协议识别弱识别属性，然后提出提示驱动的扩散模型管道生成合成行人图像，最后制定策略将合成样本融入训练数据，包括基于提示的标注规则和损失函数修改。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，无需改变模型架构即可改善真实世界中行人属性的识别性能。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

TL;DR: SALAD是一种语义感知的判别式逻辑异常检测方法，通过引入组合分支显式建模对象组合图的分布，在MVTec LOCO基准上达到96.1%的图像级AUROC，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构异常（如凹痕、划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测上表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合的预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新设计的组合分支来显式建模对象组合图的分布，学习重要的语义关系。同时引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的新型组合图提取流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上，SALAD显著优于最先进方法，实现了96.1%的令人印象深刻的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组合图分布，SALAD在逻辑异常检测方面取得了重大突破，为语义感知的异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线和离线多目标跟踪方法存在碎片化问题，无法满足实际部署场景中灵活的时间要求。在线跟踪器难以处理长期遮挡，而离线方法仍依赖启发式拼接策略。

Method: 采用统一的图神经网络框架处理非重叠子片段，通过新颖的自回归长期跟踪（ALT）层进行融合。子片段大小控制延迟和时间上下文之间的权衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进性能：DanceTrack上在线AssA提升+2.3，SportsMOT提升+9.2，MOT20提升+5.0，离线模式下提升更大。

Conclusion: NOOUGAT是第一个能够在任意时间范围内操作的多目标跟踪器，为实际部署提供了灵活性和卓越性能。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有TTA基准测试主要关注分布偏移和i.i.d.假设违反，但缺乏对真实场景中时间依赖性的建模，如视频流中连续帧显示相同对象的情况。

Method: 从目标跟踪数据集的边界框中收集目标中心图像序列构建ITD数据集，并提出对抗性内存初始化策略来改进基于内存的TTA方法。

Result: ITD数据集能够有效揭示现有TTA方法在时间依赖性挑战下的局限性，提出的对抗性内存初始化策略显著提升了多种方法在挑战性基准上的性能。

Conclusion: ITD数据集填补了TTA基准测试在时间依赖性建模方面的空白，提出的对抗性策略为处理真实世界中的时序挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Motivation: 现有深度学习人群计数方法在复杂场景中面临密度分布差异大和个体表示不一致（视角变化、姿态差异）的挑战，限制了计数精度。

Method: 提出双流图卷积网络DSGC-Net，包含密度近似(DA)分支和表示近似(RA)分支。DA分支通过密度预测模块生成密度分布图，构建密度驱动语义图；RA分支通过计算全局表示相似性构建表示驱动语义图，分别应用图卷积网络建模潜在语义关系。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上实验表明，DSGC-Net优于当前最先进方法，在ShanghaiTech Part A和Part B数据集上分别达到MAE 48.9和5.9。

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过挖掘密度变化和表示分布中的潜在特征相关性，有效提升了模型对密度变化的适应能力和多视角多姿态场景下的计数精度。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is
available at: https://github.com/Wu-eon/CrowdCounting-DSGCNet.

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中一致优于现有方法，能够以最少标注数据实现高效适应。

Conclusion: 空间语义整合具有关键价值，RS-OOD框架为遥感图像的OOD检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on

Method: 提出Learn-to-Steer框架，训练轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，然后将该分类器作为学习到的损失函数在推理时使用。采用双重反转策略避免分类器走捷径学习语言痕迹而非真实空间模式。

Conclusion: 通过直接从模型内部表示学习空间关系目标，而不是依赖手工设计的损失函数，可以更有效地改善扩散模型的空间推理能力，该方法具有很好的泛化性和效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 序数图像分类中标签边界模糊，标注过程容易产生噪声，这会严重影响监督学习模型的性能和可靠性

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，在训练过程中动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差，纠正而非丢弃噪声样本

Result: 在Adience数据集上，40%噪声情况下ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49，在原始数据集的内在噪声校正中也表现出色

Conclusion: 使用标签分布进行自适应标签校正是提升序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面的局限性，提出了MulSeT基准测试，从数据和架构两个角度评估了三种场景下的空间推理能力，发现仅靠增加训练数据无法显著提升性能，空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面仍存在困难，但缺乏全面系统的评估。现有研究往往局限于单视角或视频等孤立场景，需要从数据和架构角度进行系统性分析。

Method: 提出了MulSeT基准测试，设计了单视角、多视角和视频三种代表性场景的实验。从数据角度分析训练数据量对性能的影响，从架构角度分析位置编码在视觉编码器和语言模型中的作用。

Result: 空间理解性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限相对较低，特别是需要空间想象的任务。空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码，而非语言模型中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以实现满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计优化空间理解能力，为改进空间推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

TL;DR: MedDINOv3是一个简单有效的框架，通过多尺度token聚合架构和领域自适应预训练，将DINOv3视觉基础模型成功适配到医学图像分割任务中，在多个基准测试中达到或超越最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在医学图像分割中缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力，视觉基础模型虽然提供强大表示能力，但在医学图像上存在性能不足和领域差距大的问题。

Method: 设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，在CT-3M数据集（387万张CT切片）上进行多阶段DINOv3领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征。

Result: 在四个分割基准测试中达到或超越最先进性能，证明了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干网络的潜力。

Conclusion: MedDINOv3成功解决了视觉基础模型在医学图像分割中的适应问题，为医学图像分析提供了强大的统一骨干网络解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Conclusion: 打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a
simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for
further study. Code will be available at

Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大规模高质量标注，但专家标注存在主观性和粗糙标注带来的噪声，影响模型性能。需要解决噪声标注对特征学习的干扰问题。

Method: 提出几何距离感知模块动态调整像素级权重，结构引导标签细化模块利用结构先验优化标签，知识转移模块增强监督和对局部细节的敏感性。

Result: 在6个公开数据集上评估，GSD-Net在噪声标注下达到最先进性能，在Kvasir、Shenzhen、BU-SUC和BraTS2020数据集上分别提升2.52%、22.76%、8.87%和4.59%。

Conclusion: GSD-Net通过几何和结构双重引导有效提升了医学图像分割在噪声标注下的鲁棒性和性能，为解决标注噪声问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

Motivation: 红外和可见光图像融合在增强场景感知方面具有重要作用，但现有方法在保持轻量化的同时实现高质量融合仍面临挑战，需要新的知识蒸馏框架来提升学生模型性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的强化学习驱动协作蒸馏框架有效解决了轻量化模型高质量图像融合的难题，通过动态样本生成和指导强度调整实现了优异性能。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: 一种新的实时虚拟化妆试用框架，通过解耦化妆提取和渲染步骤，实现高保真度、身份保持且具有稳健时间一致性的美妆效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟化妆方法存在身份偏移、时间不一致、无法实时运行等问题，屏蔽半透明化妆品与皮肤颜色的关联性很难解决，影响了实际应用和公平性。

Method: 将化妆转移解耦为两个步骤：透明化妆面具提取和图形化面具渲染。使用伪真实数据训练提取模型，通过图形渲染流水线和无监督k-means聚类生成数据。重点设计了alpha权重重建捐损失和嘴唇颜色损失来提升透明度估计和颜色保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实时虚拟化妆试用中的关键挑战，通过创新的解耦结构和专门的损失函数设计，实现了高保真度、身份保持且具有稳健时间一致性的美妆效果，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Conclusion: 该方法成功自动化了视频合成过程，为视频创作和电影制作提供了高效的新解决方案。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中复杂的器官形状和各向异性的高维图像特性使得传统位置编码方法表现不佳，需要专门针对医学影像特点设计的位置编码方案。

Method: 提出了各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，这是对现有各向同性傅里叶特征编码的泛化，能够整合各向异性、类别特定和领域特定的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在胸部X光多标签分类、CT器官分类和超声心动图射血分数回归等任务中，AFPE在所有测试的各向异性设置中都显著优于最先进的位置编码方法。

Conclusion: 在各向异性的医学图像和视频中，选择适合数据和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要，AFPE为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Conclusion: MDM-MixMFL框架能够有效处理混合模态联邦学习中的异质性问题，为分布式医疗环境中的MRI图像分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.
